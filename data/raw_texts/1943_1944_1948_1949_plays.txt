PREFACE

(December 1957)

APs PLAYS making up this collection were

written between 1938 and 1950. The first, Caligula,
was composed in 1938 after a reading of Suetonius’
Twelve Cesars. I intended the play for the little theater I had organized in Algiers, and my artless intention was to play the part of Caligula myself. Inexperienced actors often show such guilelessness. Besides, I
was only twenty-five, the age when one doubts everything except oneself. The war forced me to modesty,

and Caligula was first played in 1945 at the ThéatreHébertot in Paris.
Hence Caligula is an actor’s and director’s play. But
of course it takes its inspiration from the concerns that
were mine at that moment. French criticism, although
it greeted the play very cordially, often astonished me
by speaking of it as a philosophical play. Is there any
truth in this?
Caligula, a relatively attractive prince up to then,
becomes aware, on the death of Drusilla, his sister and
mistress, that this world is not satisfactory. Thenceforth, obsessed with the impossible and poisoned with
scorn and horror, he tries, through murder and the
systematic perversion of all values, to practice a liberty
that he will eventually discover not to be the right one.
He challenges friendship and love, common human
solidarity, good and evil. He takes those about him at
their word and forces them to be logical; he levels

~ But,if his truth is to rebel against fate, his error lice :
in | negating what binds him to mankind. One cannot
thal destroy everything without destroying oneself. This
why Caligula depopulates the world around him
d, faithful to his logic, does what is necessary to
arm against him those who will eventually kill him.
PeCaigata is the story of a superior suicide. It is the
ory of the most human and most tragic of errors.
_ Unfaithful to mankind through fidelity to himself,
accepts death because he has understood that

no one can save himself all alone and that one cannot

ae _ Consequently it is a tragedy of the intelligence.
Whence the natural conclusion that the drama was intellectual. Personally, I think I am well aware of this

work’s shortcomings. But I look in vain for philosophy
in these four acts. Or, if it exists, it stands on the level
‘ of this assertion by the hero: “Men die; and they are
not happy.” A very modest ideology, as you see,
___ which I have the impression of sharing with Everyman. No, my ambition lay elsewhere. For the dramatist the passion for the impossible is just as valid a
bject for study as avarice or adultery. Showing it in
all its frenzy, illustrating the havoc it wreaks, bringing
SF out its failure—such was my intention, And the work

must be judged thereon.
~ One word more. Some found my play provocative
who nevertheless consider it natural for Cdipus to

ill his father and marry his mother and who accept
the adulterous triangle if it is placed, to be sure, in the
best society. Yet I have little regard for an art that
_ deliberately aims to shock because it is unable to convince. And if I happened, by ill luck, to be scandalous,

this would result solely from that immoderate devoin

breath at that time. Nonetheless, the play’s gloomin
bothers me as much as it bothered the public. To
courage the reader to approach the play, I shall su
gest: (1) granting that the play’s morality is not altogether negative, and (2) looking upon The Misunder- _

standing as an attempt to create a modern tragedy.

A son who expects to be recognized without having ©
to declare his name and who is killed by his mothe
and his sister as the result of the misunderstandingthis is the subject of the play. Doubtless, it is a ver ry
dismal image of human fate. But it can be reconciled
with a relative optimism as to man. For, after all, 1
amounts to saying that everything would have been
different if the son had said: “It is I; here is my name.”
It amounts to saying that in an unjust or indifferen
world man can save himself, and save others, by ea
most appropriate word.
The language shocked too. I knew this. But if I hack
dressed my characters in peplums, everyone might
have applauded. Putting the language of tragedy into —
the mouths of contemporary characters was, however,
my intention. Nothing, indeed, is more PIES is since |
a language must be found that is natural enough to be i
spoken by contemporaries and yet sufficiently unusual to suggest the tragic tone. In an effort to approach that ideal I tried to give aloofness to the char-

acters and ambiguity to the dialogues. Thus a member
of the audience was to feel simultaneously at home and
out of his element. A member of the audience, and the
reader. But I am not sure of having achieved the
proper dosage.
As for the character of the old manservant, he does
not necessarily symbolize fate. When the widow calls
upon God at the end, he is the one who replies. But
this is perhaps one more ‘misunderstanding. If he anes

_ swers “No” when she asks him to help her, this is because, in fact, he has no intention of helping her and
because at a certain level of suffering or injustice no
one can do anything for anyone. Pain is solitary.
Furthermore, I don’t really feel that such explanations are very useful. J still am of the opinion that The

Misunderstanding is a work of easy access if only one
accepts the language and is willing to grant that the
author has deeply committed himself in it. The theater
is not a game—that is my conviction.

WHEN State of Siege first opened in Paris, there
was no dissenting voice among the critics. Truly, few
plays have ever enjoyed such a unanimous slashing.
This is the more deplorable since I have never given up
thinking that State of Siege, with all its shortcomings,

is, of all my writings, the one that most resembles me.
Still, the reader is quite free to decide that, however
faithful it may be, he doesn’t like that image. But in

a

order to give greater force and freedom to that judg-

ment, I must first challenge certain presumptions. For
instance, it is better to know that:

(1) State of Siege is in no sense an adaptation of my
novel The Plague. Yo be sure, I gave that symbolic

name to one of my characters. But since he is a dictator, that appellation is correct.

(2) State of Siege is not a play of classical conception. It might better be compared with what were

Spain “autos sacramentales’—a sort of allegorical
drama which staged subjects known to the whole audience in advance. I focused my play on what seems to_
me the only living religion in the century of tyrants
and slaves—I mean liberty. Hence it is utterly useless
to accuse my characters of being symbolical. I plead
guilty. My avowed aim was to divest the stage of
psychological speculations in muffled voices so that it
might ring with the loud shouts that today enslave or

liberate masses of men. From this point of view alone,
I am still convinced

that my attempt deserves atten-

tion. By the way, this play about liberty is as badly
looked upon by dictatorships of the Right as by dictatorships of the Left. Played constantly for years in
Germany, it has never been produced either in Spain

or behind the Iron Curtain.* Much might still be said
about the hidden or obvious intentions of this play.
But I wish merely to enlighten my readers’ judgment,
not to influence it.
THE jusr assassins had more luck. It was well
received. Sometimes, however, praise, like blame, arises
from a misunderstanding. Hence I should like to make
clear that:

(1) The events recounted in The Just Assassins are
historical, even the surprising interview between the
Grand Duchess and her husband’s murderer. One must
therefore judge merely the extent to which I managed
to give plausibility to what was true.

(2) The form of the play must not mislead the
reader. I tried to achieve dramatic tension through
classical means—that is, the opposition of characters
who were equal in strength and reason. But it would
be wrong to conclude that everything balances out and

ONE WorD More to tell the reader what he will

“not find in this book. Although I have the most pas-

_

sionate attachment for the theater, I have the misfor-

tune of liking only one kind of play, whether comic or
_ tragic. After a rather long experience as director,
actor, and dramatist, it seems to me that there is no
rue theater without language and style, nor any dramatic work which does not, like our classical drama
and the Greek tragedians, involve human fate in all its

simplicity and grandeur. Without claiming to equal
hem, these are at least the models to set oneself. Psy-

_ chology, ingenious plot-devices, and spicy situations,
hough they may amuse me as a member of the audience, leave me indifferent as an author. I am willing

to admit that such a conception is debatable. But it
seems to me only fair to present myself, in this regard,

a I am. Forewarned, the reader may, if he wishes,
_ abstain from reading further. As for those who are not
discouraged by such a bias, I am more likely to awaken

i in them that strange friendship which, over and above
: - frontiers, joins reader and writer and, when it is de-

Ksvoid of misunderstanding, is the writer’s royal reward.

wanted; conscientious and inexperienced.
FIRST PATRICIAN:
But what’s come over you? There’s
no reason for all these lamentations, We've no

ground for assuming he will change. Let’s say he
loved Drusilla. Only natural; she was his sister. Or

—

say his love for her was something more than brotherly; shocking enough, I grant you. But it’s really
going too far, setting all Rome in a turmoil because
the girl has died.
CHEREA:
Maybe. But, as I said, I don’t like the look
of things; this escapade alarms me.
THE OLD PATRICIAN:
Yes, there’s never smoke without
fire.
FIRST PATRICIAN:
In any case, the interests of the
State should prevent his making a public tragedy of ;

doubt such things happen; but the less said the _
better.
HELICON:
How can you be sure Drusilla is the cause
of all this trouble?
SECOND PATRICIAN:
Who else should it be?
HELICON:
Nobody at all, quite likely. When there’s
a host of explanations to choose from, why pick on
the stupidest, most obvious one?

[Young sciPio enters. CHEREA goes toward him.]
CHEREA:
Well?
scipio:
Still nothing. Except that some peasants think
they saw him last night not far from Rome, rushing
through the storm.
[cHEREA comes back to the patricians, scivio following him.]
CHEREA:
That makes three days, Scipio, doesn’t it?

scipio:

Yes... I was there, following him as I usu-

ally do. He went up to Drusilla’s body. He stroked

it with two fingers, and seemed lost in thought for
a long while. Then he swung round and walked out,
calmly enough... . And ever since we’ve been
hunting for him—in vain.

No doubt, you think I’m crazy.
CALIGULA:
As you know well, I never think.
HELICON:
Ah, yes. . .. Now, listen! I’m not mad;

in fact I’ve never felt so lucid. What happened to
me is quite simple; I suddenly felt a desire for the
impossible. That’s all. [Pauses.| Things as they are,
in my opinion, are far from satisfactory.
HELICON:
Many people share your opinion.

‘That is so, But in the past I didn’t realize

it. Now I know.

_

[Szill in the same matter-of-fact

tone] Really, this world of ours, the scheme of
things as they call it, is quite intolerable. That’s why
I want the moon, or happiness, or eternal life—
something, in fact, that may sound crazy, but
which isn’t of this world.
HeELicon:
‘That’s sound enough in theory. Only, in
practice one can’t carry it through to its conclusion.

CALIGULA

[rising to his feet, but still with perfect

calmness|: Youre wrong there. It’s just because no
one dares to follow up his ideas to the end that
nothing is achieved. All that’s needed, I should say,
is to be logical right through, at all costs. [He studies HELICON’s face.] I can see, too, what you're
thinking. What a fuss over a woman’s death! But

that’s not it. True enough, I seem to remember that
a woman died some days ago; a woman whom I
loved. But love, what is it? A side issue. And I swear
to you her death is not the point; it’s no more than

the symbol of a truth that makes the moon essential
to me. A childishly simple, obvious, almost silly
truth, but one that’s hard to come by and heavy to
endure.

weLIcoN:

May I know what it is, this truth that

you've discovered?
CALIGULA [his eyes averted, in a toneless voice]:
Men
die; and they are not happy.
HELICON [after a short pause]: Anyhow, Caligula,

_ it’s a truth with which one comes to terms, without
much trouble. Only look at the people over there.
This truth of yours doesn’t prevent them from en- |
joying their meal.
CALIGULA [wth sudden violence]:
All it proves is
that I’m surrounded by lies and self-deception. But:

I’ve had enough of that; I wish men to live by the
light of truth. And I’ve the power to make them .
do so. For I know what they need and haven’t got.
They’re without understanding and they need a

teacher;

someone

who

knows

what

he’s ar 2

about.
HELICON:
Don’t take offense, Caius, if I give you a
word of advice. . . . But that can wait. First, you
should have some rest.

CALIGULA

[sitting down. His voice is gentle again):

That’s not possible, Helicon. I shall never rest again.
HELICON:
But—why?

caLicuLaA:

If I sleep, who'll give me the moon?

HELICON [after a short silence]: That’s true.
CALIGULA [rising to bis feet again, with an effort):
Listen, Helicon ...I hear footsteps, voices. Say
nothing—and forget you’ve seen me.
HELICON:
I understand.
cALIGULA [looking back, as he moves toward the
door}:
And please help me, from now on.
HELICON:

I’ve no reason

not to do so, Caius. But I

know very few things, and few things interest me.
In what way can I help you?
cALIGuLA:
In the way of .. . the impossible.

So you, too, love him?
Yes. He’s been very good to me. He encouraged me; I shall never forget some of the things
he said. He told me life isn’t easy, but it has conso-

iothers. He often told me that the only mistake one
_ makes i
in life is to cause others suffering. He tried to

INTENDANT [in a reproachful tone]:

Ob, Cesar...

Well, I’ve something to propose to you.

caLicuLa:

We're going to make a complete change in our
economic system. In two moves. Drastic and abrupt.
Pll explain, Intendant . . . when the patricians have
left. [The patricians go out. CALIGULA seats himself
beside cmsoniaA, with his arm around her waist.|
Now mark my words. The first move’s this. Every

ordered to disinherit his children and make a new
will leaving his money to the State.

Obviously the order of

this edict without a moment’s delay and see it’s
carried out forthwith. The wills are to be signed by
residents in Rome this evening; within a month at

the latest by persons in the provinces. Send out your

INTENDANT:

CALIGULA:

human

life has none.

the logic of my edict, and since money is the only
thing that counts, should set no value on their lives

I have the power to enforce my will. Presentl

you'll see what logic’s going to cost you? I shall
eliminate contradictions and contradicters. If necessary, I'll begin with you.
INTENDANT:
Cesar, my good will can be relied on,
that I swear.
caLicuLA:
And mine, too; that I guarantee. Just see
how ready I am to adopt your point of view, and
give the Treasury the first place in my program.

I can’t believe it’s you! But it was just a

CALIGULA:
Not quite that, Czsonia. Let’s say, a lesson
in statesmanship.
scipio:
But, Caius, it’s . . . it’s impossible!
cALicuLa:
‘That’s the whole point.

I don’t follow.
CALIGULA:
I repeat—that is my point. I’m exploiting
the impossible. Or, more accurately, it’s a question
of making the impossible possible.
scipio:
But that game may lead to—to anything! It’s
a lunatic’s pastime.

If we lie, it’s often without knowing it. I

_ CALIGULA:

Lies are never guiltless. And yours attrib-

I cannot forgive you.

cHerEA: And yet—since this world is the only one
we have, why not plead its cause?
_caLicuta: Your pleading comes too late, the verdict’s

man realizes that, he wins his freedom. [He has
risen to his feet.| And that is why I hate you, you

What you need, my dear, is a good, long
sleep. Let yourself relax and, above all stop thinking.
ll stay by you while you sleep. And when you
wake, you'll find the world’s got back its savor.
Then you must use your power to good effect—for
loving better what you still find lovable. For the
possible, too, deserves to be given a chance.
caLticuLa:
Ah but for that I’d need to sleep, to let
myself go—and that’s impossible.
cmsONIA:
So one always thinks when one is overtired. A time comes when one’s hand is firm again.
cALiguLA:
But one must know where to place it.
And what’s the use to me of a firm hand, what use
is the amazing power that’s mine, if I can’t have
the sun set in the east, if I can’t reduce the sum of
suffering and make an end of death? No, Czsonia,
it’s all one whether I sleep or keep awake, if I’ve no

power to tamper with the scheme of things.
CmsoniA:
But that’s madness, sheer madness. It’s
wanting to be a god on earth.
CALIGULA:
So you, too, think I’m mad. And yet—

what is a god that I should wish to be his equal?
No, it’s something higher, far above the gods, that

You can’t prevent the sky from being the

heart from growing cold.
CALIGULA [with rising excitement]:
I want... I
want to drown the sky in the sea, to infuse ugliness
with beauty, to wring a laugh from pain.

cmsonia [facing him with an imploring gesture):
There’s good and bad, high and low, justice and |
injustice. And I swear to you these will never
change.

leveled out, when the impossible has come to earth
and the moon is in my hands—then, perhaps, I shall

will die no more and at last be happy.

learned the truth about love; it’s nothing, nothing!
That fellow was quite right—you heard what he
said, didn’t you?—it’s only the Treasury that counts.
The fountainhead of all. Ah, now at last I’m going
to live, really live. And living, my dear, is the opposite of loving. I know what I’m talking about—and I
invite you to the most gorgeous of shows, a sight
for gods to gloat on, a whole world called to judgment, But for that I must have a crowd—spectators,

victims, criminals, hundreds and thousands of them.
[He rushes to the gong and begins hammering on it,
faster and faster.| Let the accused come forward.
I want my criminals, and they all are criminals.
[Still striking the gong.] Bring in the condemned
men. I must have my public. Judges, witnesses, ac-

cused—all sentenced to death without a hearing.
Yes, Czsonia, I'll show them something they have
never seen before, the one free man in the Roman

Empire. [To the clangor of the gong the palace has
been gradually filling with noises; the clash of arms,
voices, footsteps slow or hurried, coming nearer,
growing louder. Some soldiers enter, and leave
hastily.| And you, Czsonia, shall obey me. You
must stand by me to the end, It will be marvelous,

you'll see. Swear to stand by me, Czsonia.

THIRD PATRICIAN:

THE OLD PATRICIAN:
He’s impotent—that’s his trouble,
I should say.
[A scene of wild confusion follows, weapons are
brandished, a table is overturned, and there is a
general rush toward the door, Just at this moment
CHEREA strolls in, composed as usual, and checks
their onrush. |

CHEREA:
What’s all this about? Where are you going?
A paTriciAN:
To the palace.
cHEREA:
Ah, yes. And I can guess why. But do you
think you'll be allowed to enter?

THE PATRICIAN:
CHEREA:

‘There’s no question of asking leave,

Lepidus, would you kindly shut that door?

[The door is shut. CHEREA goes to the overturned
table and seats himself on a corner of it. The others
turn toward him.| It’s not so simple as you think,
my friends. You’re afraid, but fear can’t take the
place of courage and deliberation. In short, you’re
acting too hastily.
A KNIGHT:
If you're not with us, go. But keep your
mouth shut.
CHEREFA:
I suspect ’m with you. But make no mistake. Not for the same reasons.
A voice:
‘That’s enough idle talk.
CHEREA [standing up|: I agree. Let’s get down to
facts. But, first, let me make myself clear. Though
I am with you, I’m not for you. That, indeed, is
why I think you’re going about it the wrong way.
You haven’t taken your enemy’s measure; that’s
obvious, since you attribute petty motives to him.
But there’s nothing petty about Caligula, and you’re

-Avoice:
We

CHEREA:
No. We’ve had experience of mad emperors.
But this one isn’t mad enough. And what I loathe in
him is this: that he knows what he wants.
FIRST PATRICIAN:
And we, too, know it; he wants to
murder us all.

CHEREA:

You're wrong. Our deaths are only a side

issue. He’s putting his power at the service of a
_
loftier, deadlier passion, and it imperils everything ~
we hold most sacred. True, it’s not the first time >
Rome has seen a man wielding unlimited power;
but it’s the first time he sets no limit to his use of it,
and counts mankind, and the world we know, for _
nothing. That’s what appalls me in Caligula; that’s _
what I want to fight. To lose one’s life is no great
matter; when the time comes I’ll have the courage

to lose mine. But what’s intolerable is to see one’s
life being drained of meaning, to be told there’s no
reason for existing. A man can’t live without some _
reason for living.
FIRST PATRICIAN:
Revenge is a good reason.
CHEREA:
Yes, and I propose to share it with you. But
I'd have you know that it’s not on your account, or
to help you to avenge your petty humiliations. No,
if I join forces with you, it’s to combat a big idea—
an ideal, if you like—whose triumph would mean
the end of everything. I can endure your being
made a mock of, but I cannot endure Caligula’s
carrying out his theories to the end. He is convert-

ing his philosophy into corpses and—unfortunately
for us--it’s a philosophy that’s logical from start to
finish. And where one can’t refute, one strikes.
A voice:
Yes. We must act.
cuErREA:
We must take action, I agree. But a frontal

_ attack’s quite useless when one is fighting an im-

perial madman in the full flush of his power. You
can take arms against a vulgar tyrant, but cunning is

needed to fight down disinterested malice. You can
only urge it on to follow its bent, and bide your
time until its logic founders in sheer lunacy. As you
see, I prefer to be quite frank, and I warn you Pil
be with you only for a time. Afterward, I shall do
nothing to advance your interests; all I wish is to
regain some peace of mind in a world that has
regained a meaning. What spurs me on is not ambition but fear, my very reasonable fear of that inhuman vision in which my life means no more than
a speck of dust.
FIRST PATRICIAN [approaching him]: I have an inkling of what you mean, Cherea. Anyhow, the great
thing is that you, too, feel that the whole fabric of
society is threatened. You, gentlemen, agree with
me, I take it, that our ruling motive is of a moral
order. Family life is breaking down, men are losing
their respect for honest work, a wave of immorality
is sweeping the country. Who of us can be deaf to
the appeal of our ancestral piety in its hour of
danger? Fellow conspirators, will you tolerate a
state of things in which patricians are forced to run,
like slaves, beside the Emperor’s litter?
THE OLD patrician:
Will you allow them to be
addressed as “darling”?
A voice:
And have their wives snatched from them?
ANOTHER voice:
And their money?
ALL TOGETHER:
No!
:
FIRST PATRICIAN:
Cherea, your advise is good, and
you did well to calm our passion. The time is not
yet ripe for action; the masses would still be against
us. Will you join us in watching for the best moment to strike—and strike hard?
CHEREA:
Yes—and meanwhile let Caligula follow his
dream. Or, rather, let’s actively encourage him to

& 23

Act II

carry out his wildest plans. Let’s put method into
his madness. And then, at last, a day will come when
he’s alone, a lonely man in an empire of the dead
and kinsmen of the dead.
[A general uproar. Trumpet calls outside. Then
silence, but for whispers of a name: “caticuLa!”
CALIGULA eters with cmsoniA, followed by HELICON
and some soldiers. Pantomime. caticuia halts and
gazes at the conspirators. Without a word he moves
from one to the other, straightens a buckle om one
man’s shoulder, steps back to contentplate another,
sweeps them with his gaze, then draws his hand
over his eyes and walks out, still without a word.]
C£SONIA [ironically, pointing to the disorder of the
room]:
Were you having a fight?
:
CHEREA:
Yes, we were fighting.
cxSONIA [in the same tone|:
Really? Might I know
what you were fighting about?
cHEREA:
About... nothing in particular.
cmsonia:
Ah? Then it isn’t true.
CHEREA:
What isn’t true?
C&SONIA:
You were not fighting.
CHEREA:
Have it your own way. We weren’t fight-

cmsonia

[smiling]:

Perhaps you’d do better to tidy

up the place. Caligula hates untidiness.
HELICON [to the oLp patrician]:
You'll end by
making him do something out of character.
THE OLD paTRiciAN:
Pardon...I
don’t follow.
What have we done to him?
HELICON:
Nothing. Just nothing. It’s fantastic being
futile to that point; enough to get on anybody’s
nerves. Try to put yourselves in Caligula’s place. [A
short pause. I see; doing a bit of plotting, weren't
you now?
Really, that’s too absurd. I hope

CALIGULA [to the oLp PATRICIAN]:
Good day, darling.
[To the others] Gentlemen, ’m on my way to an
execution. But I thought I’d drop in at your place,
Cherea, for a light meal. I’ve given orders to have
food brought here for all of us. But send for your
wives first. [A short silence.| Rufius should thank
his stars that I’ve been seized with hunger. [Confidentially| Rufius, I may tell you, is the knight
who’s going to be executed.
[Another short
silence.| What’s this? None of you asks me why

I’ve sentenced him to death? [No one speaks. Meanawhile slaves lay the table and bring food.| Good
for you! I see you're growing quite intelligent.
[He nibbles an olive.| It has dawned on you that
a man needn’t have done anything for him to die.
{He stops eating and gazes at his guests with a

twinkle in his eye.| Soldiers, I am proud of you,
{Three or four women enter.| Good! Let’s take
our places. Anyhow. No order of precedence today.
[All are seated.| There’s no denying it, that fellow
Rufius is in luck. But I wonder if he appreciates

this short reprieve. A few hours gained on death,
why, they’re worth their weight in gold! [He
begins eating; the others follow suit. It becomes
clear that caLicuLa’s table manners are deplorable.
There is no need for him to: flick his olive stones
onto Ins neighbors plates, or to spit out bits of
gristle over the dish, or to pick his teeth with his
mails, or to scratch his head furiously, However,
he indulges in these practices throughout the meal,
without the least compunction. At one moment he
stops eating, stares at LEPIDUS, one of the guests,
and says roughly |You’re looking grumpy, Lepidus.

Quite the contrary, Cesar.

[Drinks again.| Now listen.

[In a gentle, faraway tone] Once upon a time there

He loved Lepidus, and to root out of his heart his

love for Lepidus, he had his youngest son killed.
[In a brisker tone| Needless to say, there’s not 2

you’re not laughing. Nobody’s laughing. Now

table.| Do you hear what I say? I wish to see you

execution—about which you will have much to say.
HELICON:
Assuming we ask your opinion.
CALIGULA:
Why not be generous, Helicon, and let
them into our little secrets? Come now, give them
a sample, Section Three, first paragraph.

HELICON [standing, declaims in a droning voice):
“Execution relieves and liberates. It is universal,
tonic, just in precept and in practice. A man dies
because he is guilty. A man is guilty because he is
one of Caligula’s subjects. Now all men are Caligula’s subjects. Ergo, all men are guilty and shall]
die, It is only a matter of time and patience.”
CALIGULA

There’s

you agree? That bit about patience was rather neat,
wasn’t it? Allow me to tell you, that’s the quality I

most admire in you... your patience. Now,

Let everyone sit down. [To Meret] Of these

one—because by crediting me with a certain wish
and presuming to oppose it you are deliberately
defying me. You are a rebel, a leader of revolt. And
that needs courage. [Sadly] I’ve a great liking for

after a brief struggle pins him down on alow couch.
He forces the phial between his lips and smashes it
with a blow of his fist. After some convulsive movements MEREIA dies. His face isstreaming with blood

ideal or his ambition. But I have no ideal, and there’s
nothing left for me to covet by way of power or
glory. If I use this power of mine, it’s to compensate,
scipio:
For what?
CALIGULA:
For the hatred and stupidity of the gods.

Oh, come! Not so many as all that. Do you
_know how many wars I’ve refused to embark on?
scipio:
No.
CALIGULA:
Three. And do you know why I refused?
scipio:
Because the grandeur of Rome means nothing to you.
CALIGULA:
No. Because I respect human life.

scipio:

You're joking, Caius.

CALIGULA:
Or, anyhow, I respect it more than I respect military triumphs. But it’s a fact that I don’t
respect it more than I respect my own life. And if I

find killing easy, it’s because dying isn’t hard for
me. No, the more I think about it, the surer I feel
that ’'m no tyrant.
scipio:
What does it matter, if it costs us quite as
dear as if you were one?

CALIGULA

[with a hint of petulance]:

If you had

the least head for figures you’d know that the small-

est war a tyrant—however levelheaded he might be—
indulged in would cost you a thousand times more

than all my vagaries (shall we call them?) put together.

scipio:

Possibly. But at least there’d be some sense be-

hind a war;

it would

be understandable—and

to

understand makes up for much.
caLicuLa:
‘There’s no understanding fate; therefore

I choose to play the part of fate. I wear the foolish,
unintelligible face of a professional god. And that is
what the men who were here with you have learned
to adore.

man can play lead in the divine comedy and become
a god. All he needs do is to harden his heart.
scipio:
You may be right, Caius. But [ rather think
you've done everything that was needed to rouse up
against you a legion of human gods, ruthless as your- —
self, who will drown in blood your godhead of a day.
CHSONIA:

CALIGULA [peremptorily|:
No, don’t stop him, Cesonia, Yes, Scipio, you spoke truer than you knew;
I’ve done everything needed to that end. I find it |
hard to picture the event you speak of—but I sometimes dream it. And in all those faces surging up out
of the angry darkness, convulsed with fear and
hatred, I see, and I rejoice to see, the only god I’ve
worshipped on this earth; foul and craven as the

human heart. [/rritably| Now go. I’ve had enough

CALIGULA:
I might have patience, only I have not

HELICON: I said I’d do my utmost. But, first, I have

something to tell you. Very serious news.
CALIGULA [as if he has not heard]:
Mind you, I’ve

moments he gazes, without moving, at the tablet. He
picks it up and reads it. Then, again, draws a deep
breath. Then summons a palace guard.]
CALIGULA:

You decided to be logical, didn’t you, poor simpleton? Logic for ever! The question now

is: Where

will that take you? [Ironically] Suppose the moon
were brought here, everything would be different.
That was the idea, wasn’t it? Then the impossible
would become possible, in a flash the Great Change
come, and all things be transfigured. After all, why
shouldn’t Helicon bring it off? One night, perhaps,
he’ll catch her sleeping in a lake, and carry her here,
trapped in a glistening net, all slimy with weeds and
water, like a pale bloated fish drawn from the depths.
Why not, Caligula? Why not, indeed? [He casts a
glance round the room.| Fewer and fewer people

Quite so. But hasn’t he some other

No. That malady of his excludes
all others.

CALIGULA:
Why, to your death, of course. Your gen- 4

than Caligula! So now you see me quite myself
again, and ready for a festive night.

No! No! I don’t want to die. You can’t be serious!

CALIGULA [in a thoughtful voice, between the shrieks]:

sunshine! The smiles of life. [cassrus is near the

MarRTHA:
A good sign, that. But usually rich men
don’t travel alone. Really it’s that makes things so |
difficult. You may have to wait ages when you’re fe
looking out for a man who is not only rich but neeoe
alone.

All l’m longing for is peace—to be able to relax a

see you smile now and again.
_Martua: I do smile sometimes, I assure you.

Really? I’ve never seen you.
MARTHA:
That’s because I smile when I’m by myself,

a
something ends. Then, too, while we have had few

opportunities, they have been spread out over many
years, and memory helps to build up habits. Yes,

it’s over.

Indeed we shall—and what a glorious mo-

ment that will be! So, cheer up, mother, there won’t
be much to do. You know quite well there’s no
question of killing. He’ll drink his tea, he’ll go to
sleep, and he’ll be still alive when we carry him to
the river. Some day, long after, he will be found
jammed against the weir, along with others who
didn’t have his luck and threw themselves into the

water with their eyes open. Do you remember last
year when we were watching them repair the
sluices, how you said that ours suffered least, and

:

life was crueler than we? So don’t lose heart, you ‘ll
be having your rest quite soon and I'll be seeing
what Pee never seen.
THE MOTHER:
Yes, Martha, I won’t lose heart. And
it was quite true, what you said about “ours.” I’m
always glad to think they never suffered. Really, it’s
hardly a crime, only a sort of intervention, a flick

of the finger given to unknown lives. And it’s also
quite true that, by the look of it, life is crueler than
we. Perhaps that is why I can’t manage to feel
guilty. I can only just manage to feel tired.

[The OLD MANSERVANT Comes in. He seats himself
behind the bar and remains there, neither moving
nor speaking, until JAN’s entrance.]|
MARTHA:
Which room shall we put him in?
THE MOTHER:
Any room, provided it’s on the first
floor.
MARTHA:
Yes, we had a lot of needless trouble last

time, with the two flights of stairs. [For the first
time she sits down.| Tell me, mother, is it true that
down on the coast the sand’s so hot it scorches one’s
feet?
THE MOTHER:
As you know, Martha, I’ve never been
there. But I’ve been told the sun burns everything
up.
MARTHA:
I read in a book that it even burns out
people’s souls and gives them bodies that shine like
gold but are quite hollow, there’s nothing left inside.
THE MOTHER:
Is that what makes you want to go
there so much?
MARTHA:
Yes, my soul’s a burden to me, I’ve had
enough of it. I’m eager to be in that country, where
the sun kills every question. I don’t belong here.
THE MOTHER:
Unfortunately we have much to do
beforehand. Of course, when it’s over, I’ll go there
with you. But I am not like you; I shall not have
the feeling of going to a place where I belong.
After a certain age one knows there is no resting
place anywhere. Indeed there’s something to be
said for this ugly brick house we’ve made our home
and stocked with memories; there are times when
one can fall asleep in it. But, naturally it would
mean something, too, if I could have sleep and

the

door.| Well, Martha, get everything ready.

by another door. For some moments only the op
MANSERVANT is on the stage. JAN enters, stops,
glances round the room, and sees the old man
sitting behind the counter.]
yan:
Nobody here? [The old man gazes at him,
rises, crosses the stage, and goes out. MARIA enters.
JAN swings round on her.| So you followed me!

short silence. Maria is examining the room.| So
this is the place?
_ jan: Yes. That’s the door I went out by, twenty
_
-years ago. My sister was a little girl. She was playing
in that corner. My mother didn’t come to kiss me.
At the time I thought I didn’t care.
_ Maria:
Jan, I can’t believe they failed to recognize
you just now. A mother’s bound to recognize her

~ yan: Perhaps. Still, twenty years’ separation makes a
difference. Life has been going ‘on since I left. M
mother’s grown old, her sight is failing. I hardly
recognized her myself.
MaRiIA [impatiently]:
I know. You came in; you
said “Good day”; you sat down, This room wasn’t
like the one you remembered.

Jan: Yes, my memory had played me false. They
received me without a word. I was given the glass

It wasn’t an idea of mine, Maria; it was th

my father’s death I realized I had duties toward
these two women and now, as a result, ’m doing ~
what it’s right for me to do. But evidently it

Maria:
But why not let them know the truth a
once? There are situations in which the normal wa

of acting is obviously the best. If one wants to b "
recognized, one starts by telling one’s name; that’sBy
common sense. Otherwise, by pretending to be "
what one is not, one simply muddles everything.
How could you expect not to be treated as a stran-

ger in a house you entered under false colors? No,
dear, there’s UAE
. something morbid
about the way you're doing this.

V’ll have a better notion of what to do to make them

happy. Afterwards, I'll find some way of getting
them to recognize me, It’s just a matter of choosing
one’s words.
maria:
No, there’s only one way, and it’s to do
what any ordinary mortal would do—to say nies
I,” and to let one’s heart speak for itself.
jan:
The heart isn’t so simple as all that.
MarRIA:
But it uses simple words. Surely there was
no difficulty in saying: “I’m your son. This is my
wife. I’ve been living with her in a country we both
love, a land of endless sunshine beside the sea. But
something was lacking there to complete my happiness, and now I feel I need you.”
JAN:
Don’t be unfair, Maria. I don’t need them; but
I realized they may need me, and a man doesn’t
live only for himself.
[A short silence, Maria looks away from him.|
MarIA:
Perhaps you are right. I’m sorry for what I
said. But I have grown terribly suspicious since
coming to this country where I’ve looked in vain
for a single happy face. This Europe of yours is so
sad. Since we’ve been here, I haven’t once heard
you laugh, and, as for me, I feel my nerves on edge
all the time. Oh, why did you make me leave my
country? Let’s go away, Jan; we shall not find
happiness here.
yan:
It’s not happmess we’ve come for. We had
happiness already.
Maria [passionately]:
‘Then why not have been satisfied with it?
jan:
Happiness isn’t everything; there is duty, too.
Mine was to come back to my mother and my own
country. [MARIA makes a protesting gesture and
is about to answer. JAN checks her. Footsteps can
be heard.| Someone’s coming. Do please go, Maria.
MARIA:
No, I can’t, I can’t! Not yet, anyhow!

gently pushes her toward the door at the back. The
OLD MANSERVANT crosses the room without seeing
MARIA, and goes out by the other door.| Now, leave
at once. You see, luck is on my side.

a word, only to stay beside you till you’re recog-

in the eyes.]
Marta:
Jan, we've been married for five years.
yan:
Yes, almost five years.
maria [lowering her eyes]: And this will be the
first night we spend apart. [He says nothing and
she looks up, gazing earnestly at him.| Vve always

you to be other than you are. [’m not a very
troublesome wife, am I? But here I’m scared of the
empty bed you are sending me to, and I’m afraid,
too, of your forsaking me.
jan:
Surely you can trust my love better than that?
maria: I do trust it. But besides your love there are
your dreams—or your duties; they’re the same
thing. They take you away from me so often, and
at those moments it’s as if you were having a holiday from me. But I can’t take a holiday from you,
and tonight [She presses herself to him, weeping},
this night without you—oh, I shall never be able ta
bear it!
JAN [clasping her tightly]:
But this is childishness,
my dear!
maria:
Of course it’s childish. But... but we
were so happy over there, and it’s not my fault if
the nights in this country terrify me. I don’t want
to be alone tonight.

“Maria:
What promise?

MaRIA:
You’ve another promise to keep.
JAN: Yes?

maria:

The promise you made me on the day you

joined your life to mine.

yan:
But surely I can keep both promises. What I’m
asking of you is nothing very terrible. Nor is it a
mere caprice. Only one evening and one night in
which to take my bearings here, get to know better
these two women who are dear to me, and to secure
their happiness.
MARIA [shaking her head]: A separation always
means a lot to people who love each other—with
the right kind of love.
jan:
But, you romantic little creature, you know
quite well I love you with the right kind of love.
mariA:
No, Jan. Men do not know how real love
should be. Nothing they have can ever satisfy them.
They’re always dreaming dreams, building up new
duties, going to new countries and new homes,
Women are different; they know that life is short
and one must make haste to love, to share the same
bed, embrace the man one loves, and dread every
separation. When one loves one has no time for
dreams.
JAN:
But, really, dear, ent you exaggerating? It’s
such a simple thing I’m doing; trying to get in
touch again with my mother, to help her and bring
her happiness. As for my dreams and duties, you'll
have to take them as they are. Without them I’d
be a mere shadow of myself; indeed you’d love me
less, were I without them.

means stand upon your rights as a guest. But do not
go beyond them.
jan:
I beg your pardon. Nothing was further from
my intention than to offend you; I only wanted to
show my good will. I had a feeling that perhaps we
weren’t quite so remote from each other as you
seem to think; no more than that.
martTHa:
I can see I must repeat what I was saying.
There can be no question of offending me or not
offending me. Since you seem determined to adopt
an attitude that you have no right to adopt, I prefer
to make things clear. I can assure you I’m not in
the least vexed. Only it is in our interest, yours and
mune, that we should keep our distance. If you
persist in talking in a manner unbecoming a guest,
there’s no alternative; we must refuse to have you
here. But if you will understand, as I cannot doubt
you will, that two women who let you a room in
their hotel are under no obligation to treat you as a
friend into the bargain, all will go smoothly.
yan: I quite agree; and it was inexcusable, my giving
you an impression that I failed to understand this.
martHa:
Oh, there’s no great harm done. You are
mot the first who’s tried to take that line. But I always made it pretty clear how we felt about such
matters, and that settled it.
gan:
Yes, you certainly have made it clear, and I
suppose I’d better say no more—for the present.
psaarTHa:
Not at all. There’s nothing to prevent
your talking as a guest should talk.
gan: And how should a guest talk?
martTHa:
Most of our guests talk about all sorts of
things: politics, their travels, and so forth. Never
about my mother or myself—and that is as it should
be. Some of them even talk about their private lives
or their jobs. And that, too, is within their rights.
After all, one of the services for which we’re paid

Act {
is listening to our customers. But it goes without
saying that the charges made for board and lodging
don’t oblige hotelkeepers to answer personal questions. My mother may do so sometimes, out of
indifference; but I make a principle of refusing.
Once you've grasped this, we shall not only be om
excellent terms, but you'll discover you have many
things to tell us, and that sometimes it’s quite pleasant to be listened to when one’s talking about
oneself.
jan:
I’m afraid you won't find me much good at
talking about myself. But, really, that won’t be
necessary. If I stay here only a short time, there
will be no point in your getting to know me. And
if I make a long stay, you'll have plenty of oppertunity of knowing who I am, without my speaking.
MarTHA:
I hope you will not bear me any malice
for what I’ve told you. There’d be no reason for it,
anyhow. I’ve always found it better to be quite
frank, and I had to stop your talking in a tone that
was bound to lead to strained relations. Really, P’'m
asking nothing out of the way. Until today there
was nothing in common between us, and some very
special reasons would be needed for our suddenly
becoming intimate. And you must forgive me if J
fail to see, so far, anything in the least resembling 4
reason

of that kind.

If a son came here, he’d find exactly what an ordinary guest can count on: amiable indifference, no
more and no less. All the men we have had here
received that, and it satisfied them. They paid for
their rooms and were given a key. They didn’t
talk about their hearts. [A short silence.] That
simplified our work.

Don’t talk about that.

If you are rich, so much the better. But no
more talk about your heart, please. We can do nothing about that. In fact your way of speaking got so
much on my nerves that I very nearly asked you to
go. Take your key and make yourself comfortable
im your room, But remember you are in a house
where the heart isn’t catered to. Too many bleak
years have passed over this little spot of Central
Europe, and they’ve drained all the warmth out of
this house. They have killed any desire for friendliness, and, let me repeat it, you won’t find anything
in the least like intimacy here. You will get what the
few travelers who lodge with us are used to getting
and it has nothing to do with sentiment. So take
your key and bear this well in mind: we’re accepting you as a guest, in our quiet way, for interested

Not for money, but for a home beside the a

may be tired of living, but I, too, am tired, tired to —

death of these narrow horizons. I feel I couldn’t
endure another month here. Both of us are sick of —

this inn and everything to do with it. You, who are_
old, want no more than to shut your eyes and to ii
forget. But I can still feel in my heart some of the ve
absurd desires I had when I was twenty, and iste
want to act in such a way as to have done with them
forever—even if, for that, we must go a little
further with the life we want to leave. And really
it’s your duty to help me; it was you who brought’
me into the world in a land of clouds and mist, in- |
stead of a land of sunshine.
THE MOTHER:
Martha, I almost wonder if it wouldn’t
be better for me to be forgotten, as I’ve been forgotten by your brother, than to hear you speaking
to me in that tone, the tone of an accuser.

MarTHA: You know well I did not mean to wound

could I do without you? What would become of me
if you were far away? I, anyhow, could never,
never forget you, arid if at times the strain of this

I beg you, mother, to forgive me.

ou’ve played on my human feelings; now I hope

You have a very strange way

arTHA:
My mother’s desires are weaker than mine;
that’s only natural. She doesn’t think enough about
the sea and those lonely beaches to make her realize
you have got to stay. So she hasn’t the same motives for wanting to keep you. But, at the same

it. And, meanwhile, this man has no suspicion; he is
_ enjoying his repose. If we let him wake he’ll have
to start life again, and from what I’ve seen of him,
I know he is much like other men and cannot live
in peace. Perhaps that is why we must take him
there and hand him over to the mercy of the dark

water. [She sighs.| But it’s a sad thing so much effort should be needed to rid a man of his follies and
put him in the way of peace.
MarTHA: I can only think, mother, that your wits are
wandering. I repeat, we have much to do. Once he’s
thrown in, we shall have to efface the marks on the
riverbank, blur our footsteps on the path, destroy
his clothes and baggage—make him vanish from the
face of the earth, in fact. Time’s passing and soon it
will be too late to carry all this out with the composure that it needs. Really I cannot understand
what has come over you, to be sitting at that man’s
bedside and staring at him, though you can hardly
see him, and persisting in this absurd, useless talk.
THE MOTHER:
‘Tell me, Martha. Did you know that
he meant to leave this evening?
MARTHA:
No, I didn’t. But if ’d known, it wouldn’t
have changed anything, once I had made up my
mind.

He told me that just now, and I didn’t
know how to answer him.

it, if I had been in time. As it was, once I knew he

things take their course; really it hadn’t much importance.

THE MOTHER [im a toneless voice}:
Yes, I always

would be the end. The end of all!

eo MarTHA [coming from behind the bar and standing
in front of it]: Mother!
THE MoTHER:
No, Martha, let me have my way; I’ve
lived quite long enough. I have lived many years
more than my son. That isn’t as it should be. Now
I can go and join him at the bottom of the river,
where the weeds already have covered up his face.
marTHA:
Mother! Surely you won’t leave me alone?
THE MOTHER:
You have been a great help to me,
Martha, and I am sorry to leave you. If such words
have any meaning left for us, I can honestly say you
were a good daughter, in your fashion. You have
always shown me the respect you owed me. But
now I am very weary; my old heart, which seemed
indifferent to everything, has learned again today
what grief means, and I’m not young enough to
come to terms with it. In any case, when a mother
is no longer capable of recognizing her own son, it’s
clear her role on earth is ended.

MarTHA:

No. Not if her daughter’s happiness re-

mains to be ensured, And, no less than my heart,
my hopes are shattered when I hear you speaking in
this new, amazing way—you who had taught me
to respect nothing.
THE MOTHER [i7 the same listless tone]:
It only
proves that in a world where everything can be
denied, there are forces undeniable; and on this

earth where nothing’s sure we have our certainties.
|Bitterly | And a mother’s love for her son is now
my

certainty.

MARTHA:
So you are not sure that a mother can love
her daughter?

_ THE MOTHER:

It’s not now I’d want to wound you, : |

Martha, but love for a daughter can never be the

~

same thing. It strikes less deep. And how could be
‘s ;
now live without my son’s love?
MARTHA:
A wonderful love—that forgot you mia? Wy,

for twenty years!
THE MOTHER:

4

Yes, it was a wonderful love that out-

a

lasted twenty years of silence. Say what you will,
that love is wonderful enough for me—since I can’t
live without it. [She rises from her chair.]
MARTHA:
It’s not possible you can talk like that, —
without any thought for your daughter, without —
the least stirring of revolt!

THE MOTHER:

Hard as it is on you, it is possible. I

have no thought for anything; still less any feeling

of revolt. No doubt this is my punishment, and for

__

all murderers a time comes when, like me, they are
dried up within, sterile, with nothing left to live
for. That’s why society gets rid of them; they’re

good for nothing.
‘
MaRTHA: I can’t bear to hear you talking like that,
about crime and punishment; it’s . . . despicable!
THE MOTHER:
I’m not troubling to pick my words;
I’ve ceased to have any preference. But it’s true
that by one act I have ruined everything. I have
lost my freedom and my hell has begun.

MaRTHA [going up to her mother; fiercely|: You
never spoke like that before. During all these years
ou’ve stood beside me, and your hands never
flinched from gripping the legs of those who were

to die. A lot you thought of hell or freedom in those
days! It never occurred to you that you had no
right to live, and you went on—doing as you did.

What change can your son have brought to that?

4

THE MOTHER:
I went on with it; that’s true. But
what I lived through then, I lived through by dint
of habit, which is not so very different from death.

[They

gaze silently at each other; MartHa lowers her eyes.
She speaks now in a very low voice.] I ask so little,
so very little of life. Mother, there are words I
never could bring myself to use, but—don’t you
think it would be soothing if we started our life
again just as it used to be, you and I together? —

yourself; this world doesn’t make sense. But yo
weren’t altogether wrong in asking me that eye
tion. For I know now that if I’d recognized him,i

would have made no difference.
THE MOTHER: I prefer to think that isn’t true. Now :
soul is wholly criminal, and the wickedest mur-_
derers have moments when they lay down their BS
arms.
MARTHA:
I have such moments, too. But I woul

not have lowered my head to a brother whom ie ee
did not know and who meant nothing to me.
THE MOTHER:
‘To whom then would you lower your
head?
[marTHA lowers her head.]
MARTHA:
To you.

THE MOTHER [quietly]: Too late, Martha. I can do
nothing more for you. [Half averting her eyes.

‘THE MoTHER:
Weariness, perhaps . . . and my long-

ing for rest.
}
[She goes out. MARTHA makes no effort to detain
her. Once her mother has left she runs to the door,

slams it to, and presses herself against it. She breaks
into loud, fierce cries.|
MARTHA:
No, no! What concern of mine was it to
look after my brother? None whatever! And yet
now I’m an outcast in my own home, there is no
_ place for me to lay my head, my own mother will
have none of me. No, it wasn’t my duty to look
after him—oh, the unfairness of it all, the injustice
done to innocence! For he—he now has what he
wanted, while I am left lonely, far from the sea I
longed for. Oh, how I hate him! All my life was
spent waiting for this great wave that was to lift me
up and sweep me far away, and now I know it will

never come again. I am doomed to stay here with all
those other countries, other nations, on my left hand
and my right, before me and behind; all those plains
and mountains that are barriers to the salt winds

blowing from the sea, and whose chatterings and
grumblings drown its low, unceasing summons, [/7
a lower tone] There are places to which, far as they
may be from the sea, the evening wind brings sometimes a smell of seaweed. It tells of moist seabeaches,
loud with the cries of seagulls, or of golden sands
bathed in a sunset glow that has no limit. But the sea ae
winds fail long before they reach this place. Never, —
never shall I have what’s due to me. I may press my
ear to the earth but I shall not hear the crash of icy

breakers, or the measured breathing of a happy sea. —
I am too far from all I love, and my exile is beyond
remedy. I hate him, yes, I hate him for having got _
what he wanted! My only home is in this gloomy,
shut-in country where the sky has no horizons; for
my hunger I have nothing but the sour Moravian
sloes, for my thirst only the blood that I have shed.
That is the price one must pay for a mother’s love!
There is no love for me, so let her die. Let every
door be shut against me; all I wish is to be left in
peace with my anger, my very rightful anger. For
I have no intention of rolling my eyes heavenward
or pleading for forgiveness before I die. In that
southern land, guarded by the sea, to which one can
escape, where one can breathe freely, press one’s
body to another’s body, roll in the waves—to that
sea-guarded land the gods have no access. But here
one’s gaze is cramped on every side, everything
is planned to make one look up in humble supplication. I hate this narrow world in which we are
reduced to gazing up at God.

But I have not been given my rights and I am
smarting from the injustice done me; I will not
bend my knee. I have been cheated of my place on
earth, cast away by my mother, left alone with my
crimes, and I shall leave this world without being
reconciled. [A knock at the door.| Who’s there?

- said on this earth, I knew that no good would come
to me here, but this is sheer craziness and I will not
share in it. At the very moment when your words
strike death into my heart, it seems to me that you
are talking of some other man, not of the man who
shared my nights, and all this is a tale of long ago,
in which my love never had a part.
MarTHA:
It’s not for me to convince you; only to
tell you the truth. A truth which you will have to
recognize before long.

Maria [in a sort of reverie]:
do it?
MARTHA:

MARIA

But why, why did you

What right have you to question me?
[passionately]: What right? ... My

love

for him.
MARTHA:

What does that word mean?

MarRIA:
It means—it means all that at this moment is
tearing, gnawing at my heart, it means this rush of

frenzy that makes my fingers itch for murder. It
means all my past joys, and this wild, sudden grief
you have brought me. Yes, you crazy woman, if it
wasn’t that I’ve steeled my heart against believing,
you'd learn the meaning of that word, when you
felt my nails scoring your cheeks.

MaRTHA:

Again, you are using language I cannot

understand. Words like love and joy and grief are
meaningless to me.

[making

a great

effort to speak

calmly]:

Listen, Martha—that’s your name, isn’t it? Let’s
stop this game, if game it is, of cross purposes.
Let’s have done with useless words. Tell me quite
clearly what I want to know quite clearly, before I
let myself break down.
MARTHA:
Surely I made it clear enough. We did to

your husband last night what we had done to other
travelers before; we killed him and took his money.

on her breast; in a low, sad more:

Oh, my God,

having lent ourselves to it. I felt danger in the very

air one breathes in this country. [She stops in front
of the table and goes on speaking, without looking
at MARTHA.]

He wanted to make his home-coming

a surprise, to get you to recognize him and to bring
you happiness. Only at first he couldn’t find the
words that were needed. And then, while he was
groping for the words, he was killed. [Weeping.]
And you, like two madwomen, blind to the marvelous son who had returned to you—for marvelous he
was, and you will never know the greatheartedness,
the noble soul, of the man you killed last night. . . .
He might have been your pride, as he was mine.
But, no, you were his enemy—oh, the pity of it!—
for else how could you bring yourself to speak so
calmly of what should make you rush into the street,
screaming out your heart, like a wounded animal?

A musical overture built around a theme recalling
the sound of an air-raid siren.
When the curtain rises the stage is in darkness.
The overture ends, but the drone of the siren per- —
sists in the background.
Suddenly a comet rises stage-right, then glides
slowly across the blackness of the sky toward stage- a
left, showing up in outline the walls of a Spanish
fortified city and the forms of some people standing
with their backs to the audience and gazing up at the
comet.
A clock strikes four. The dialogue that now begins —
is barely comprehensible, a muttering of broken
phrases.

It’s the end of the world.
Don’t talk nonsense!
If the world is dying...
The world, maybe; not Spain.
Even Spain can die.
On your knees, and pray for mercy!
It’s the comet of evil.
Not of Spain; there’ll always be a Spain!
[Two or three people turn their heads. Some shift
their positions cautiously.x.Then all are motionless

again, while the buzzing in the’ air grows louder,
shriller, more insistent, and, taken up by the orchestra, acquires the tone of a threatening voice.
The comet, too, swells prodigiously. Suddenly a
woman screams; at her scream the music stops

but summer coming in. [Shouts of joy.] No sooner
ends the spring than the golden orange of summer,
launched across the sky to crown the season of the
year, bursts above Spain in a shower of honey,
while all the fruits of all the summers of the world
—butter-yellow melons, luscious grapes, figs oozing
blood, and apricots aflame—pour

down in torrents

on our market-stalls. [Shouts of joy.| Here ends
their long, swift course in baskets from the countryside where they drank deep of sweetness and the
juices of the soil till they hung drooping over
meadows blue with heat amid innumerable springs
of living water which, drawn through roots and
stems, wound its way to their hearts, in a neverfailing honeyed flow, swelling them out and making
them heavier day by day.
Heavier, ever heavier! So heavy that in the end
they sank through the limpid air, set to trundling
over the lush grass, took ship on rivers or traveled
along roads from the four points of the compass,
acclaimed by joyful shouts and the clarion calls of
summer. [Brief bugle-calls.| So now they throng
the cities of men in testimony that the fathering
sky has kept its tryst with fertile mother earth.

[All join in a shout of triumph.)

No, we

have

nothing to fear. Summer has come again, bringing
largess, not disaster. Winter and its hard fare lie far
ahead. Today we have cheeses scented with rosemary, and the gifts of smiling seas—mullets, dories,
fresh sardines, and lobsters. The goats’ milk froths
like soapsuds, and on marble slabs the red meat
frilled with crisp white paper and redolent of clover
proffers for men’s nourishment blood and sap and

sunlight. Here’s to the flower of the year, the cycle
of the seasons ringing their changes! Let’s drink
ourselves into oblivion, nothing will happen!

[The siren theme of the overture, which has been
droning in the background for some minutes, suddenly rises to an ear-splitting stridence, and there
are two ponderous thuds. One of the actors on the
raised platform, while moving to the front and
gesturing, staggers and topples over the edge among
the crowd, which surges in on the fallen body.
Complete silence follows; no one moves or speaks.
A sudden commotion; virco is thrusting his way
through the crowd, which slowly draws apart, revealing the prostrate man. Two doctors come up,
examine the body, then, moving aside, confabulate
excitedly.
A young man accosts one of the doctors, and in
pantomime, asks for an explanation; the doctor
makes a gesture of refusal. But the young man is
persistent, and seconded by the bystanders, presses
him to answer, grips his shoulders, shakes him, and
finally grapples with him until their faces are quite
close, their lips almost touching. A gasp, a quick
intake of breath is heard—as though the young man
were snatching a word from the doctors mouth.
Then he moves away and after great efforts, as if
the word were too big to be got out, ejaculates:

“Plague!”

Everyone sags at the knees*and totters. Meanwhile the word travels from mouth to mouth,
louder and louder, faster and faster, while all take
to their heels and circle wildly round the dais on

making known my wishes. [The FIRST ALCALDE

_
THE MAN:
Excellent. Now that’s settled, will you
be kind enough, my dear, to make known to the
Alcalde the rules and regulations he is to promulgate to these good people, so that they may start
living under state control.

THE

SECRETARY:

Regulation

Number

One,

drawn

up and promulgated by the Kirst Alcalde and _his
Committee.
FIRST ALCALDE:
But IJ haven’t drawn up anything yet!
THE SECRETARY:
We’re saving you the trouble. And
it seems to me you should feel flattered at the
trouble our department is taking to frame these
regulations that you will have the honor of signing.

_ First Part
FIRST ALCALDE:

THE SECRETARY:

Quite so. All the same...

This regulation shall carry the force

of an edict issued and validated in pursuance of the
will of our beloved sovereign, for the control and
charitable succor of all citizens infected with disease,

and for the issuance of by-laws and the guidance of
all personnel appointed under the said edict, such as
overseers, attendants, guards, and gravediggers, who
will be bound by oath strictly and punctually to
carry out all such orders as may be given them.
FIRST ALCALDE:
Might I know the point of all this —
rigmarole?
THE SECRETARY:
It’s intended to get them used to
that touch of obscurity which gives all government
regulations their peculiar charm and efficacy. The
less these people understand, the better they'll behave. You get my point? Good. Here are the
regulations that I’ll ask you to have proclaimed by
the town criers in every district, so that they may
be mentally digested by your townsfolk, even by
those whose mental digestions are most sluggish.
Ah, here they come, the town criers. Their pleasant
appearance will help to fix the memory of what
they say in the minds of their hearers.

[The town

criers line up.]

VOICES IN THE CROWD:
‘The Governor’s going away!
The Governor’s leaving us!

napa:

And he has every right to do so, remember

that, good people. He is the government and goyernments must be protected.
VOICES IN THE crRowD:
He was the government,
and now he’s nothing! The Plague has stepped into
his shoes.
NADA:
What can that matter to you? Plague or Governor, the government goes on.

will deliver me from man and the terrors that infest
him? How happy I was but a little while ago at the
summit of the year, taking my ease among the
fruits; when nature was kind and smiled on me. I
loved the world, Spain and I were at one. But no
longer can I hear the sound of the waves. All
around are panic, insults, cowardice, my brothers
are sodden with fear and sweat, and my arms are
too weak to succor them. Who will give back to
me the waters of forgetting, the slumbrous smoothness of the open sea, its liquid pathways, long furrows that form and fold upon themselves? To the
sea! To the sea, before the gates are shut!
A voice:
Take care! Keep clear of that man who
was just beside the corpse.
A voice:
Yes, he has the marks.

the bird cage. Oh, and don’t forget the dog’s collar.
And the pot of mint as well. We can munch it on
our way to the sea.

Stop thief! He’s stolen our damask tablecloth, the one we used at my wedding.

pocket for a loaf of bread, just one!

[The Fifth Gate closes.]
cHorus:
Quick! Only one gate is left. The Plague
moves faster than we. He hates the sea and wants
to cut us off from it. Out there the nights are
calm, stars glide above the masthead, mirrored in
the blue. What’s the Plague after in this city? He
wants to keep us in his clutches, for he loves us in
his fashion. He wants us to be happy, not in the
way we like, but in the way that he approves of.
Penitential pleasures, cold comfort, convict happiness. Everything is turning hard and dry, no longer
do we feel the cool kiss of the wind upon our lips.
voice:
Do not leave me, priest; I am one of the
poor men of your flock. [The priest begins to walk
away.| Look! He’s going... . No, stand by me,
it’s your duty to look after me, and if I lose you,

then I’ve lost all. [The priest guickens his steps.
The poor man falls to the ground with a great cry.]
Christians of Spain, you are forsaken!
FIFTH TOWN CRIER [emphasizing each word]:

Lastly,

and this will be the summing-up. [Standing in front
of the FIRST ALCALDE, the PLAGUE and the SECRETARY
exchange smules and looks of self-satisfaction.] So as

to avoid contagion through the air you breathe and
since words are carriers of infection, each of you

is ordered to keep permanently in his mouth a pad

soaked in vinegar. This will not only protect you
from the disease but teach you discretion and the
art of silence.
[From now on everyone has a handkerchief in his
mouth and the number of voices steadily diminishes,
as does the volume of the background music. Beginning with several voices, the cHorus ends with
that of a single speaker, and finally there is a pantomime, during which the lips of all are puffed out
and firmly closed. The Last Gate is slammed to.|

cHorus:

Alas! Alas! The last gate is shut and we are

A Be crowds, Cadiz will become a huge, red-and-black
arena in which ritual murders are to be enacted.
Brothers, our plight is surely greater than our sin;
we did not deserve this imprisonment. True, our

hearts were not innocent, still we greatly loved the
world of nature and its sammers—surely that might

have saved us from this doom. The winds have
failed, the sky is empty, for a long while we shall
be silent. But for the last time, the last, before fear
gags our mouths for many a long day, let us lift
our voices in the desert.

buzzing of the comet starts again, very softly. The

That is why when I step in all sentiment goes by

and so are other imbecilities, such as the fuss you~ “nee

of these I give you organization. That will worry F
you a bit to start with, but very soon you'll realize ie
that good organization is better than cheap emotion. — a
By way of illustration of this excellent precept I
shall begin by segregating the men from the women.

This order will have the force of law. [The Guards
promptly carry out the order.|
.
Your monkey-tricks have had their day; the time —
has come for realizing that life is earnest.
os
I take it you have grasped my meaning. As from
today you are going to learn to die in an orderly ©
manner. Until now you died in the Spanish manner,
haphazard—when you felt like it, so to say. You

died because the weather suddenly turned cold, or _
a mule stumbled; because the skyline of the Pyre- —
nees was blue and the river Guadalquivir has a
fascination for the lonely man in springtime. Or
else it was because there are always brawling fools
ready to kill for money or for honor—when it’s

so much more elegant to kill for the delight of being logical. Yes, you muffed your deaths. A dead
man here, a dead man there, one in his bed, another
in the bull ring—what could be more slovenly?
But, happily for you, I shall impose order on all
that. There will be no more dying as the fancy
takes you. Lists will be kept up—what admirable
things lists are!—and we shall fix the order of your
going. Fate has learned wisdom and will keep its
records, You will figure in statistics, so at last you'll
serve some purpose. For, I was forgetting to tell
you, you will die, that goes without saying, but
then—if not before—you will be packed off to the
incinerator. Nothing could be more hygienic and
efficient, and it fits in with our program. Spain first!
So line up for a decent death, that’s your first
duty. On these terms you will enjoy my favor. But
take care that you don’t indulge in nonsensical ideas,
or righteous indignation, or in any of those little
gusts of petulance which lead to big revolts. I have
suppressed these mental luxuries and put logic in
their stead, for I can’t bear untidiness and irrationality. So from this day on you are going to be rational

and tidy; the wearing of badges will be compulsory.
Besides the mark on your groins you will have the
plague star under your armpits, for all to see—meaning that you are marked down for elimination. So
the others, people who think these marks are no
concern of theirs and line up cheerfully for the
bullfight every Sunday, will treat you as suspects
and edge away from you. But you need not feel
agerieved; these marks concern them also, they’re
all down on our lists and nobody is overlooked. In
fact all are suspects—that’s the long and the short
of it.

Don’t take all this to mean I haven’t any feelings.
As a matter of fact I like birds, the first violets of

THE SECRETARY:
Your private concern, you say?
Those words don’t mean anything to us. What interests us is your public life, and that as a matter of

It’s in the rules. And it’s an excellent

of existence before I can get a certificate of health.
THE SECRETARY:
‘That goes without saying.
THE FISHERMAN:
“Goes without saying!” What do
you mean by that?
THE SECRETARY:
Why, it proves that this city is beginning to reap the benefits of a strong administration. We start with the premises that you are
guilty. But that’s not enough; you must learn to feel,
yourselves, that you are guilty. And you won’t feel
guilty until you feel tired. So we weary you out;
that’s all. Once you are really tired, tired to death in
fact, everything will run quite smoothly.
THE FISHERMAN:
Anyhow, is there some way of
getting this damned certificate of existence?

couldn’t. You see, you need to get a certificate of

a long, restrained cry, the cry of hearts that are
separated, and it tells of sunlit seas at noon, the
fragrance of reeds at nightfall, the sweet embraces
of our women. Our faces are sealed up, our steps
counted, our hours fixed—and yet our hearts reject
this silence of the grave. They reject the never-ending forms to be filled out, the miles and miles of
walls; barred windows; and daybreaks bristling with
guns. They reject these things as does he who is
fleeing from this setting of shadows and numbers,
seeking a house for refuge. But the only refuge is

your side when you made those cowardly excuses
to the captain who challenged you to a duel,
after you’d made a false declaration so as to escape
your military service? Was the law on your side
when you asked that girl who was suing a dishonest
employer to sleep with you?

freedom of the great sea spaces, empty skies of
summer, love’s undying fragrance. But meanwhile

then are dragged down by the weight of water on

backs, and until the day when these battle cries have
spent their force, we listen only to the slow tides of
happiness murmuring deep down within us. When
the bare boughs of the almond trees grow bright
with frost flowers we shall straighten up a lictlet
fanned by a rising wind of hope, and soon in that
second springtime we shall hold our heads high
once more. Then those we love will turn again to

the plague had dried up. Summer is passing, and
soon we shall no longer have the grapes of the vine

Third Part —

_ THE PLAGUE:
What authority have you to question
my orders?
THE SECRETARY:
‘The authority of memory. For I
have not forgotten what I was before you came.
Then I was free, an ally of the accidental. No one
hated me, I was the visitant who checks the march
of time, shapes destinies, and stabilizes loves. I
stood for the permanent. But you have made me the
handmaid of logic, rules, and regulations. And I

have lost the knack I had of sometimes being helpful.
THE PLAGUE:
Who wants your help?
THE SECRETARY:
‘Those who are not big enough to
face a sea of troubles. Nearly everyone, that is to
say. Quite often I could work in a sort of harmony
with them; I existed, in my fashion. Today I do
violence to them, and one and all they curse me
with their last breath. Perhaps that’s why I like this

man whom you are telling me to kill. He chose me
freely, and, in his way, he pitied me. Yes, I like
people who meet me halfway.
THE PLAGUE:
You'd do better not to irritate me.
.. . We have no need for pity.
THE SECRETARY:
Who could need pity more than
those who themselves have none? When I say I
like this man, what I mean is really that I envy
him. For, with conquerors like us, love takes the
ugly form of envy. You know this well and you
know, too, that for this reason we deserve a little
pity.

THE PLAGUE:

‘That’s enough! I order you to keep

silent!
THE SECRETARY:
You know it well and you know,
too, that when one kills enough one comes to envy
the innocence of those one kills. Oh, if only for a

made a success of it. I like my name to live upon

that their love, too, can be stubborn.

The secretary

retreats a little, into a patch of

shadow. VICTORIA runs toward DIEGO.|

Oh, Diego, what have you done to our
happiness?
pirco:
Good-by, Victoria. I am glad it’s so.
vicrortA:
Don’t talk like that, my love! That’s one
of those horrible things men say. [Weeping.] No
one has the right to be glad to die.
pico:
But I am glad, Victoria. I did what I was
called upon to do.
victorta:
No, you should have chosen me, though
all the powers of heaven forbade you. You should
have preferred me to the whole earth.
pieco:
I have squared up accounts with death—there

lies my strength. But it is an all-devouring strength;
happiness has no place in it.
victoria:
What did your strength matter to me? It
was you—the man you were—that I loved.

I have burned myself out in the struggle. I
am no longer a man and it is right that I should die.

But that wasn’t enough! No,
even that was not enough! You loved me with your fe
soul, perhaps, but I wanted more than that, far

more.
[The secretary stretches her hand toward vreco.
The death agony begins, while the women hasten
toward vicroria and gather round her.|
CHORUS OF WOMEN:
Our curse on him! Our curse
on all who forsake our bodies! And pity on us, most
of all, who are forsaken and must endure year after
year this world which men in their pride are ever
aspiring to transform! Surely, since everything may
not be saved, we should learn at least to safeguard
the home where love is. Then, come war, come
pestilence, we could bravely see them through with
you beside us. Thus, instead of this solitary death,
haunted by foolish dreams and nourished with
words, your last end would be shared by us, we
would die united in an all-consuming flame of love.

But no! Men go whoring after ideas, a man runs
away from his mother, forsakes his love, and starts
rushing upon adventure, wounded without a scar,

slain without a dagger, a hunter of shadows or a
lonely singer who invokes some impossible reunion
under a silent sky, and makes his way from solitude
to solitude, toward the final isolation, a death in the
desert.

shouting on the battlements.|
NADA? Here they are, the old gang! They all are
coming back: the men of the past, the fossils, the
dead-enders, the triflers, smooth-tongued, comfort_ able—the army of tradition, robust and flourishing,
_ spick and span as ever. So now we can start all over
again, and what a relief for everyone! From zero
if naturally. Here they come, the tailors of nonentity,
you'll have your new suits built to order. But there’s
no need to worry, their method is the best. Instead
of shutting the mouths of those who air their
grievances, they shut their own ears. We were
dumb, we are going to be deaf. [Trumpet calls.]
Look! The writers of history are coming back and
we shall soon be reading all about our heroes of the
plague. They will be kept nice and cool under the

of course, but all the time I was thinking of Russia
and her slaves.

I’m glad, Stepan, that the party sent you

Quite sure.

a month now, two of our group have been watching
the Grand Duke’s movements hour by hour. Dora
has compiled all the facts we need to know.
STEPAN:
Has the proclamation been drawn up?
ANNENKOv:
Yes. All Russia will know that the Revo-—
lutionary Socialist Party has executed the Grand
Duke Serge so as to bring nearer the day when the
Russian people are set free. And the Imperial Court
will learn that we are resolved to carry on the
reign of terror, of which this bomb is the beginning, until the land is given back to its rightful
owners, to the people. Yes, Stepan, everything’s set,
and we won't have long to wait.
STEPAN:
Where exactly do I come in on this?
ANNENKOV:
To begin with, you will help Dora.
You'll replace Schweitzer, who used to work with
her.

Yes, I’ve had two good long looks at it.

how proud of it I was. [To stepan and ANNENKOV. |

get away with it!” In fact they tried to learn my
tricks.

And of course you laughed.
KALIAYEV:
You know quite well I can’t help laughing. Anyhow, it was all so entertaining—the plunge
into a brand-new life, wearing that fancy dress... .
DorA:
I can’t bear fancy dress. Look at what I’m
wearing now. Some actress’s castoff frock. Really,
Boria might have chosen something else. There’s
nothing of the actress about me. I’ve an incorrigibly
simple heart.

KALIAYEV

[laughing]:

But you look so pretty in it.

Dora:
Pretty! I’d like to be pretty ... but that’s
one of the things I mustn’t think about.
KALIAYEV:
Why not? Dora, there’s always such a sad
look in your eyes. But you should be gay, you
should be proud. There’s so much beauty in the
world, so much joy. “In those quiet places where
my heart once spoke to yours . .”

It'll be steady as a rock, I assure you, when the time
comes. Or do you suppose I’d hesitate when I have
that tyrant in front of me? No, you can’t seriously
imagine that. And even if for some reason my arm
started shaking, I know a certain way of killing the
Grand Duke.

very likely. Yet I believe in our ideal quite as firmly

when it’s called for. Only, I’m still convinced that —
life is a glorious thing, I’m in love with beauty, hap-_

at last the innocent, and only they, will inherit the
earth.

work yourself up, you go forward to the sacrifice —

have to come out of your dream and face reality,
the dreadful thing you are to do. Perhaps it’s best to
speak of this beforehand—so that you won't be

Oh, Yanek, it’s best for you to know, to be forewarned! A man is a man. Perhaps the Grand Duke
has gentle eyes, perhaps you'll see him smiling to
himself, scratching his ear. Perhaps—who knows?
—you'll see a little scar on his cheek where he cut
himself shaving. And, if he looks at you, at that
moment... .
KALIAYEV:
It’s not he I’m killing. I’m killing despotism.

‘That’s quite true. And despotism must be
killed. Pll get the bomb ready and when I’m screwing in the tube—that’s the moment when it’s touch

Grand Duke; it wouldn’t be anything so easy if

sad they looked! Dressed up in their best clothes,

_ with their hands resting on their thighs, like two

sTEPAN:
I wonder if you people realize what this
decision means? Two solid months of shadowing,
of hairbreadth escapes—two wasted months! Egor
arrested to no purpose. Rikov hanged to no purpose.
Must we start that all over again? Weeks and weeks
of harrowing suspense without a break; of sleepless
nights, of plotting and scheming, before another
opportunity like this comes our way. Have you all
gone

crazy?

ANNENKOv:
In two days’ time, as you know quite
well, the Grand Duke will be going to the theater
again.
STEPAN:
‘Two days during which we run the risk of
being caught at any moment; why, you've said so
yourself!
KALIAYEv:
I’m off!

No, wait. [To stepAN] You, Stepan, could you
fire point blank on a child, with your eyes open?

I could, if the group ordered it.

Why did you shut your eyes then?
sTeEPAN:
What? Did I shut my eyes?

STEPAN:

Yes.

Then it must have been because I wanted to

picture . . . what you describe, more vividly, and
to make sure my answer was the true one.

Open your eyes, Stepan, and try to realize that
the group would lose all its driving force, were it to
tolerate, even for a moment, the idea of children’s
being blown to pieces by our bombs.

STEPAN:
Sorry, but I don’t suffer from a tender heart;

that sort of nonsense cuts_no ice with me. . . . Not

about children will the revolution triumph, and we

what you've justved for the» sake f all that

you

have done for us and with us. . . . Now, let’s keep
Reto the matter in hand. The question is whether,
__presently, we are to throw bombs at those two
Children! There you go, always talking
an
;: about children! Cannot you realize what is at stake?

Just because Yanek couldn’t bring himself to kill
those two, thousands of Russian children will go on
; dying of starvation for years to come. Have you
ever seen children dying of starvation? I have. And
oy to be killed by a bomb is a pleasant death compared
_ with that. But Yanek never saw children starving to
_ death. He saw only the Grand Duke’s pair of darling
_ little lapdogs. Aren’t you sentient human beings? Or
are you living like animals for the moment only? In
_ that case by all means indulge in charity and cure
each petty suffering that meets your eye; but don’t
_
meddle with the revolution, for its task is to cure all
sufferings present and to come.

_ pora:

Yanek’s ready to kill the Grand Duke because

__ his death may help to bring nearer the time when
Russian children will no longer die of hunger. That
in itself is none too easy for him. But the death of
_ the Grand Duke’s niece and nephew won't prevent

any

child from dying of hunger. Even in destruc-

- tion there’s a right way.and a wrong way—and there
are limits.
_ STEPAN [vehemently]:
There are no limits! The

_

truth is that you don’t believe in the revolution, any
of you. [All, except KALIAYEV, rise to their feet.]
No, you don’t believe in it. If you did believe in it
sincerely, with all your hearts; if you felt sure that,
by dint of our struggles and sacrifices, some day we
shall build up a new Russia, redeemed from despot-

ism, a land of freedom that will gradually spread out
over the whole earth; and if you

felt convinced

;

his superstitions, man will at last Iso febetas

sky, a god in his own right—how, I ask you, co
the deaths of two children be weighed 1in the balan
against such a faith? Surely you would claim for
yourselves the right to do anything and mies
you draw the line at killing these two children weell,
it simply means you are not sure you have that right.

So, I repeat, you do not believe in the revolution.
[There is a short silence. KALIAYEV, too, rises to bis
5
feet.]
rit
KALIAYEV:
Stepan, I am ashamed of myself—yet I
cannot let you continue. I am ready to shed blo
so as to overthrow the present despotism. But, |
hind your words, I see the threat of another despott
ism which, if ever it comes into power, will m:
of me a murderer—and what I want to be is
doer of justice, not a man of blood.

KALIAYEV:
Well, you must feel very sure that day is
coming if you repudiate everything that makes life
worth living today, on its account.
sTePAN:
I am certain that that day is coming.
KALIAYEV:
No, you can’t be as sure as that... . Before it can be known which of us, you or I, is right,

erhaps three generations will have to be sacrificed;
there will have been bloody wars, and no less bloody
revolutions. And by the time that all this blood has
dried off the earth, you and I will long since have
turned to dust.
STEPAN:
‘Then others will come—and I hail them as
my brothers.
KALIAYEV [excitedly, raising his voice]:
Others, you
say! Quite likely you are right. But those / love are
the men who are alive today, and walk this same
earth. It’s they whom I hail, it is for them I am fighting, for them I am ready to lay down my life. But
I shall not strike my brothers in the face for the sake
of some far-off city, which, for all I know, may not
exist. I refuse to add to the living injustice all around
me for the sake of a dead justice. [In a lower voice,
but firmly| Brothers, I want to speak to you quite
frankly and to tell you something that even the
simplest peasant in our backwoods would say if you
asked him his opinion. Killing children is a crime
against a man’s honor. And if one day the revolution
thinks fit to break with honor, well, ’m through
with the revolution. If you decide that I must do it,
well and good; I will go to the theater when they’re
due to come out—but Pl fling myself under the
horses’ feet.
.
STEPAN:
Honor is a luxury reserved for people who
have carriages-and-pairs.
KALIAYEV:
No. It’s the one wealth left to a poor man.
You know it, and you also know that the revolution
has its code of honor. It’s what we all are ready to

die for. It’s what made you hold your head up,
Stepan, when they flogged you, and it’s behind what
you have been saying to us today.
STEPAN [shrilly]:
Keep quiet! I forbid you to speak
of that!

KALIAYEV [angrily]:

Why must I keep quiet? I took

it lying down when you said I didn’t believe in the
revolution. Which was as good as telling me that I
was ready to kill the Grand Duke for nothing; that
I was a common murderer, I Jet you say that—and
somehow I kept my hands off you!
ANNENKOv:
Yanek!
STEPAN:
It’s killing for nothing, sometimes, not to kill
enough.
ANNENKov:
Stepan, none of us here agrees with you.
And we have made our decision.
sTEPAN:
‘Then I bow to it. Only, let me tell you once
again that squeamishness is out of place in work like
ours. We’re murderers, and we have chosen to be
murderers.

KALIAYEV

[losing all self-control]:

‘That’s a lie! I

have chosen death so as to prevent murder from
triumphing in the world. I’ve chosen to be innocent.
ANNENKov:
Yanek! Stepan! That’s enough of it. The
group has decided that the slaughter of these children would serve no purpose. We must start again

from the beginning, and be ready for another try
at it in two days’ time.
sTEPAN:
And supposing the children are there again?
KALIAYEV:
‘Then we shall await another opportunity.
sTePAN:
And supposing the Grand Duchess is with
the Duke?
KALIAYEV:
Her I shall not spare.

When I heard the carriage in the distance I said to
myself: “Good! Only a minute more!” I gritted
my teeth, every muscle in my body was taut as
steel, and if I’d flung the bomb at that moment I
really believe its mere impact would have killed the
Grand Duke. I waited, waited, for the first explosion, which was going to release that pent-up
energy. But it never came. The carriage rumbled

by. How fast it went! It was past me in a flash. And
then I realized that Yanek hadn’t thrown his bomb.
I went cold all over, icy cold. And suddenly all the
strength went out of me and I felt weak as a child.
ANNENKOv:
Don’t take it to heart, Alexis. That was
just a passing lapse; life and strength come back.
vornov:
‘Iwo days have gone by but they haven’t
come back to me. Just now I lied to you; I couldn’t

everything!
ANNENKOv:
Don’t let what’s happened get you down,
Alexis. We’ve all had the same experience at some
time or another. You won’t be asked to throw the
bomb. You must take a month’s rest in Finland, and
then come back to us.
vornov:
No, it’s not so simple as all that. If I don’t
throw the bomb today I shall sever throw one.
ANNENKOV:
Oh, come now! You're exaggerating.
vornov:
No, Boria, it’s the simple truth. ’m not made

for me to leave you. [ll do my bit in propaganda,

ANNENKOv:

attend meetings, work out plans, and then pass
orders for their carrying out. You risk your life of

then. You were right, Dora; it’s not so simple as it
seems. I thought it was quite easy to kill, provided
one has courage and is buoyed up by an ideal.
But now I’ve lost my wings. I have realized that
hatred brings no happiness. I can see the vileness in
myself, and in the others, too. Murderous instincts,
cowardice, injustice. ’ve got to kili—there are no
two ways about it. But I shall see it through to the

Love? No, that’s not what is needed.
KALIAYEV:
Oh, Dora, how can you say that? You of
all people, you whose heart I know so well!
DORA:
‘Too much blood, too much brutal violence—
there’s no escape for us. Those whose hearts are set
on justice have no right to love. They’re on their

toes, as I am, holding their heads up, their eyes
fixed on the heights. What room for love is there
in such proud hearts? Love bows heads, gently,
compassionately, We, Yanek, are stiff-necked.
KALIAYEV:
But we love our fellow men.
DORA:
Yes, we love them—in our fashion. With a vast
love that has nothing to shore it up, that brings
only sadness. The masses? We live so far away from
them, shut up in our thoughts. And do they love
us? Do they even guess we love them? No, they
hold their peace. Ah, that silence, that unresponsive
silence!
KALIAYEV:
But surely that’s precisely what love
means—sacrificing everything without expecting
anything in return?
orA:
Perhaps. Yes, I know that love, an absolute,
ideal love, a pure and solitary joy—and I feel it
burning in my heart. Yet there are times when I

wonder if love isn’t something else; something more
than a lonely voice, a monologue, and if there isn’t

so of thinking of ourselves, just you and me, for a

Still, he has leanings toward religion. That’s 4

why we didn’t hit it off. I’m more bitter than he. For people like me, who

don’t believe in a God,

there is no alternative between total justice and
utter despair.

‘To Yanek’s mind there’s an element of despair

in justice itself.
STEPAN:
Yes, he has a weak soul. But happily he’s
better than his soul, his arm won’t falter. Yanek will
kill the Grand Duke, I’d swear to it. And it will be
a good day’s work, a very good day’s work. Destruction, that’s what’s wanted. But you’re not saying anything. [Scans her face attentively.] Are you

Why should I want their precious love? I learned
all about it three years ago, in the convict prison.

ACT IV
A cell in the Pugatchev Tower of the Butirki Prison.
Morning light is filtering through a barred window.
When the curtain rises Kaliayev is looking toward
the door. A Guarp enters, followed by a prisoner
carrying a mop and bucket.
THE GUARD:

Now

then!

Get down to it!

[The cuarp takes his stand at the window, FOKA,
the prisoner, begins to wash the floor; he takes no
notice of KALIAYEV. A short silence.|
KALIAYEV:
What’s your name, brother?
FOKA:
Foka.
KALIAYEV:
Are you a convict?
FOKA:
What else should I be?
KALIAYEV:
What did you do?
FoKA: I killed.
KALIAYEV:
You were hungry, no doubt?
THE GUARD:
Ssh! Not so loud!

KALIAYEV:

What?

THE GUARD:
Don’t speak so loud. It’s really against
the rules for you to talk. So I'd advise you to talk

quietly, like the old man.
KALIAYEV:
Is that why you killed—because you were
hungry?
)
FoKA:
No. I was thirsty.
KALIAYEV:
Yes? And then?

about with it good and proper. I killed three people,

But tell me first; you're sorry for... for what _
happened, aren’t you?
FoKa:
Sure, I’m sorry. Twenty years’ hard, that’s a Ws
long stretch. Enough to make anyone feel SOIry.
KALIAYEV:
Twenty years. I come here when I’m |
twenty-three—and when I go out, my hair is gray. _
FoKA:
Oh, cheer up! There’s no knowing with a
judge; depends on whether he’s married, and what
his wife is like. Maybe he’ll be in a good humor and

let you off easy. And then you're a fine gentleman.
It ain’t the same for a gentleman and people like
me. You'll get off lightly.
KALIAYEV:
I doubt it. And anyhow I don’t want to.
Feeling shame for twenty years—how horrible that
would be!
FokA:
Shame? Where does the shame come in?
That’s just one of those crackbrained notions you
gentlemen have. . . . How many people did you

KALIAYEV:
One man.
FoKA:
One man? Why, that’s nothing!
KALIAYEV: I killed the Grand Duke Serge.
FoKA:
The Grand Duke? Well, I'll be damned! You
fine gentlemen never know where to draw the line.

Yes, it looks black for you.
KALIAYEV:
Very black. But I had to do it.

Why? What business does a man like you have
getting himself into trouble like that? Ah, I see.
Over a woman, wasn’t it? A good-looking young

He had made a date with God, far out in

so deeply sunk that it took him the best part of an
hour, helping to pull the cart out. When this was
done Dimitri made haste to the appointed place.
But he was too late. God had left.

ALIAvEV: +Then—there are some who always arrivea
too late, because there are too many bogged carts
on the way, too many brothers to help out. [Foxa

That’s incorrect.

- xautayey:

Accusation is not the word. I am a pris-

leave politics out of it and look at the human side.
_ A man has been killed—and killed in a particularly
horrible manner.

a you persist in talking about a “verdict” and asserting

that it was the party, and the party alone, that

ihe

tried and executed the victim—that, in short, the

KALIAYEV [furiously]: But, damn it, I don’t ceo

sit in judgment on me. You can kill me if you

think fit, and that is the only right you have over—
my person. Oh, I can see what you're leading up to. _
You are trying to find a chink in my armor, you are _
hoping to make me feel ashamed of myself, burs

No. As a matter of fact we haven’t. But
if you decide to live, we shall arrest them.

I wonder if I’ve really understood... .
skuRATOV:
Certainly you have. Don’t lose your temper—that would be premature. Think it over first.
Obviously from the standpoint of the idea—the
ideal, if you prefer the word—you cannot hand
them over to us. But from a practical point of view
you'd be doing them a service. You would be preventing them from getting into further trouble, and
by the same token, you’d be saving them from the
gallows. And, best of all, you would regain your
peace of mind. So, from whatever angle you look
at it, you'd be doing the best thing. [KALIAYEV is

Your informer. He was informing us as

well—up to a point. But, I ask you, why did you
spare them?
KALIAYEV:
‘That’s no concern of yours.
SKURATOV . [Jaughing|:
Oh, come now! ... Well,
Pil tell you why. An ideal can murder a Grand
Duke, but it balks at murdering children. That was

the discovery you made that day. But let’s carry it
a stage further, If an ideal balks at murdering children, is one justified in murdering a Grand Duke

on its behalf?

[katiavev makes a fretful gesture.|

No, don’t answer me. It’s not I who am concerned
in this. You will give your answer to the Grand
Duchess.
KALIAYEV:
The Grand Duchess?
skurATOv:
Yes, she wants to see you. And my chief
reason for coming here was to make sure that this
was feasible. It is. It may even make you change
your mind. The Grand Duchess is a very Christian
lady. Indeed one might say she makes a hobby of
the soul. [Laughs.]
KALIAYEV:
I refuse to see her.
skurATov:
Im sorry, but she will not take No for
an answer. And, after all, you owe her some consideration. What’s more, it seems that since her
husband’s death she has become—how shall I put
it?—mentally unbalanced. So we thought it better

not to oppose her wishes. [Standing in the doorway.] If you change your mind, don’t forget my

* proposal. I shall be seeing you again. [A short silence. He is listening.| Here she comes. You certainly can’t complain of being neglected! But it all
hangs together. Imagine God without prisons! One
would be lost without the other.

What crime? All I remember is an act of

exactly the same voice as his. But, I suppose, all
men use the same tone when they speak of justice.

centuries untold. And in return for this he was

frankly, for I would like you to understand. I have
given up counting on the agreement that I once

made with God. But, in dying, I shall keep the

are justly entitled.

our authority for killing; and will mot pay with

to pass which testifies for us; a sign for all the
revolutionaries of the world. Yanek is a murderer
no longer. A hideous crash! That was enough to
plunge him back into the carefree joy of childhood.

CALIGULA
AND 3 OTHER

PLAYS

BY ALBERT

CAMUS

“One
Although

word...to

tell the reader what

I have the most passionate

the misfortune

he will not find in this book.

attachment

for the theater, I have ©

of liking only one kind of play, whether comic or tragic.”

After a rather long experience as director, actor, and dramatist,
to me

that there is no true theater without

dramatic

work

which

does not, like our

language

classical

it seems ~

and style, nor

drama

and

any —

the Greek —

tragedians, involve human fate in all its simplicity and grandeur. Without

_

claiming to equal them, these are at least the models to set oneself. Psychology,

ingenious

plot devices,

and spicy situations,

though

they may

amuse me as a member of the audience, leave me indifferent as an author.

I am willing to admit that such a conception

is debatable. But it see

to me only fair to present myself, in this regard, as I am. Forewarned,

the

reader may, if he wishes, abstain from reading further. As for those who are not discouraged by such a bias,

I am more

likely to awaken in them

that strange friendship which, over and above frontiers, joins reader and

writer, and, when it is devoid of misunderstanding,

is the writer’s royal

reward.”— Albert Camus, in the Preface.
