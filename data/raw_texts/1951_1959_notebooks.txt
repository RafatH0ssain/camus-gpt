TRALN'SL,A TOR'S NOTE
A WRITER'S  N(rrEBOOK  is a peculiar  thing. To look at a writer's raw
notebooks,  his unpolished  jottings,  is to see a man, to know his works,
and to watch them grow. It is to get a taste of the life, the human  being,
behind  the books and essays,  even when that person  has seemingly  tried
not to reveal himself.
Some might contend  that Camus  always  intended  to publish  his cahiers
(as he called them),  or, at the very least, that by 1954 the thought  had
crossed  his mind when he began to have formal  typescripts  made of the
first seven volumes. Whether  it proves  intent or not, we do know that
Camus  corrected  these seven typescripts  as they were being prepared.  In
the  United  States,  after  his  death,  the  first  six  of  these  cahiers  were
published  in two volumes,  Notebooks  1935-1942  and Notebooks  1942-
1951. Of the cahiers contained  in those previous  volumes,  some were
fully corrected  by the author and some only partially  corrected  in various
stages and drafts.  In this third and final volume  of Camus'  Notebooks,
only the very first cahier (VII) was made into a typescript  while the author
was still living, and even this one was only partially  corrected by the
author before his death.
As established  in the original  French  edition,  the rest of what follows-
cahiers,  letters,  and notes-was  taken straight  from the original  handwritten
source,  unadulte rated, unaltered  save for a few proper  names.  Thus these
final cahiers presented  a series of translation  challenges  not fully present
in the two earlier volumes.  Throughout  the manuscript,  occasion ally there
occurs  a word or series of words that Camus'  small, tight script renders
completely  illegible; over the years many have joked that only four people
could ever read his handwriting:  his wife, his lover, his daughter , and
Camus  himself  (and sometimes  even they had to use a magnifying glass
to do so). Similarly , in some spots Camus'  script seems decipherable,  but

certainty  is impossible;  these occurrences  have been recorded  with the
note "questionable  reading"  or "unclear  word,"  to indicate  the possibility
of alternative interpretations.  One can assume  what they will about the
earlier Notebooks,  but these last volumes,  as evidenced,  come to us in the
raw.
This being the case, I have gone to great lengths  to try to preserve  the
manner  of these last notebooks  accurately  in their translation  into English.
These entries are not always  solid pieces of polished  prose; they are often
notes  at  the  rudimentary  level,  they  do  not  always  contain  complete
sentences  or thoughts,  and they are indeed  often ambiguous.  Occasionally
an entry will trail off, or words will be dropped  in a sort of shorthand;
sometimes  Camus  has "dinner  with B.M."  and sometimes  just "Dinner
B.M." Sometimes  we read of The Fall or The Possessed,  and sometimes
just of Fall or Possessed.  Occasionally  we get long, complex,  intricate
sentences,  and at other times short, clipped,  elliptical  sentences.  These
differences,  though sometimes  slight, are clearly  present  in the original
French,  and  when  possible  they  have  been  maintained  in  the  English
translation.
Although,  for the sake of clarity, grammar  and punctuation  have been
edited in places,  for the most part, even when an entry appears  less than
grammatically  perfect,  even when a question  mark or quotation  mark is
missing,  as long as this is how Camus  recorded  the original  entry, no
changes  have been made for the English  translation.  The intent of this
precision  is to lend a certain  authenticity  to the true flavor of these last
notebooks,  sometimes  seemingly  composed,  other times apparently only
cryptic notes the author himself would fully understand.
That said, the greatest  liberty  taken with this translation  involves  the
insertion  of commas,  without  which many of these entries  would prove
quite  difficult  to  read  and  decipher .  An  examination  of  Camus'
handwritten  drafts, even of formal  works such as Le Premier  Homme,
reveals  that the author often eschewed  spaces,  commas,  and even periods.
While fidelity has been held as an essential  ingredient  in translating  the

particular  manner  of  these  writings,  in  certain  places  clarity,  at  the
sentence level, seemed just as necessary .
Finally, all the quotations  cited here by Camus  have been translated
from the French  version  that he recorded  in these cahiers,  not from their
original  source  language.  In the case of quotations  originally  appearing  in
English,  often  their  French  counterparts  contain  slight  differences  in
wording  and  structure,  differences  that  have  been  preserved  here  as
Camus wrote them.
Translating  these cahiers  has been an incredible  journey , an incredible
insight  into the final years of one of the French  language's  most enduring
writers,  a voice still so relevant  today, perhaps  even more so than in the
past. My sincere  hope is simply  that you will enjoy these final pages and
final thoughts, this final and most personal glimpse, as much as I did.

EDITORS' NOTE
[from the French edition]
THIS THIRD  VOLUME  of the Notebooks  includes  cahiers  VII, VIII,
and IX, kept by Albert  Camus  from March  1951 until his death. Cahier
VII, from March 1951-July  1954, was typed up while the author was still
living and was partially  corrected  by him. This is undoubtedly  the reason
cahier VII contains  passages  that are not in the original  manuscript.  On
the  other  hand,  certain  pages  of  the  manuscript  were  removed,
undoubtedly by the author , in the typed version.
In the following  notebooks,  a notation  has been made each time one or
more  words  could  not  be  deciphered.  In  addition,  for  understandable
reasons, we have removed some proper names and changed some initials.

INTRODUCTION
AS  THIS  final  volume  of  his  Notebooks  begins,  Albert  Camus  is
completing  what would become  his most controversial  book, L'Homm.e
Revolte  (The Rebel).  Its publication  in October  1951, seven months  after
this volume opens, sets off a polemic  so aggressive  that its effects, both
political  and personal,  reverberate  throughout  the remainder  of Camus'
life.
The most widely  noted result of the publication  of L'Homme  Revolte  is
the quarrel with Sartre,  which rapidly and very publicly  unfolded  in the
pages of Les Temps Modernes  in the summer  of 1952. By September  of
that year, newspapers  such as Le Monde  and Samedi-Soir  were already
labeling the Camus-Sartre break "of ficial."
In December , still reeling  from the Temps Modernes  polemic,  Camus
returned  home to Algeria,  visiting the southern  part of the country  which
he had never before  seen. Although  earlier  in the year he had already
begun  to  sketch  ideas  for  a  short-story  collection  tentatively  titled
Nouvelles  de l'exil, it was undoubtedly  in Laghouat  that the story "La
Femme adultere" took shape.
Before  returning  to Paris, Camus  met with the French  actor Marcel
Herrand  in Nice. Herrand  was again set to direct the Festival  d'Angers, as
he had the year before,  but, terminally  ill with cancer, he died just days
before  the  festival  began,  leaving  Camus  to  take  his  place. Although
thrown  into the experience,  one can assume  Camus  enjoyed  the positive
critical  reaction,  as  four  years  later,  in  June  1957,  he  returned  to  the
festival,  this time directing  his own Caligula  as well as Lope de Vega's Le
Chaevalier d'Olmedo.
It was around  this time, the fall of 1953, that Camus'  wife, Francine,
fell into a serious  and lasting  depression,  probably , at least in part, as a

result of Camus'  infidelity , which was fairly public in France  and not at all
a secret from Francine.  Although,  if by most accounts,  he tried not to
openly  expose  his  wife  to  his  philandering,  he  also  did  little  to
successfully conceal it.
On November  7, 1953, in his own cloud of depression,  Camus  turned
forty. Less than a month  earlier, Actuelles  II, Camus'  latest collection  of
essays,  letters, and speeches,  had been published  by Gallimard,  receiving
generally  warm  yet  unenthusiastic  reviews,  which  did  little  to  lift  his
spirits.  In mid-1954 the last of his "lyrical  essay"  collections,  L'Ete, was
published.
In  October,  over  the  course  of  four  days,  Camus  visited  the
Netherlands,  spending  a day in The Hague  and two days in Amsterdam,
the city that would  become  the setting  of his last completed  novel, La
Chute.  During the final months  of his life, Camus  had been planning  a
return trip to the Netherlands  to scout locations  for a possible  television
adaptation  of the novel, but the trip, and the adaptation,  would never be
made.
In November , as fighting  in Algeria escalated,  Camus  became  more
and more anguished over the state of his homeland,  escaping  to Italy on
the  invitation  of  the  Italian  Cultural  Association,  a  trip  that  is  well
documented  in Notebook  VIII. Not long after this trip, in April 1955,
Camus  took  his  first,  long  awaited,  vacation  to  Greece,  also  well
described  in these pages. Upon his return to Paris in mid May, he accepted
a job with L'Express, a weekly  journal,  but it was short-lived:  in February
1956,  with  tensions  concerning  Algeria  tightening  throughou t  France,
Camus quit the paper and focused on finishing La Chute.
Shortly  before  ceasing  his work for L'Express,  on January  22 Camus
launched  his "Appeal  for a Civil Truce" in Algeria.  As he notes in these
pages,  even  if  he  found  some  peace  in  being  "in  the  struggle,"  the
atmosphere  in Algiers  was nothing  less than hostile,  requiring  him to hire
bodyguards  to prevent  possible  abduction  attempts  and perhaps  to try to
calm his nerves  regarding  reported  death threats.  By May the idea and

possibility  of a civil truce had disintegrated.  At this point, as can be seen
in the letter dated April 3 in the Appendix  of this volume,  Camus  removed
himself from the public arena in regard to the  Algerian question.
In May 1956, La Chute was published  to mixed reviews.  Soon after,
conditions  at home not improving,  Camus  moved  out of the apartment  he
shared  with his wife, an apartme nt that to this day bears the Camus  name
on the buzzer .
In the summer  months, preparing  to stage his adaptation  of Faulkner's
Requiem  for a Nun and unable  to cast Maria Casares-his  longtime  lead
actress  and mistress-for  fear of worsening  his wife's condition,  Camus
was forced to cast a new leading lady: Catherine  Sellers,  one of the four
women with whom he would come to spend his last years.
1957 was a busy year for Camus.  His collection  of short stories,  now
titled L'Exil et le Royaume,  was published,  as was his essay on the death
penalty, "Reflexions  sur la guillotine,"  which was packaged  alongside  an
essay by Arthur  Koestler  in a book titled Reflexions  sur la peine capitale.
But  the  biggest   news  came  in  October ,  when  it  was  announced  that
Camus  had  won  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Literature,  an  award  that  again
opened  him to personal  attacks  from his critics.  In the last months  of
1957,  as  noted  in  Notebook  VIII,  Camus  began  to  suffer  from  acute
respiratory  attacks  coupled  with  severe  claustrophobia  and  depression,
afflictions that would last well into the following year .
In 1958, Camus  ended his silence on the Algerian  question  with the
publication  of Actuelles  III:  Chroniques  al-  geriennes,  a  collection  of
essays and speeches he had composed between  1939 and 1958. He spent a
good bit of the year working  on his stage adaptation  of Dostoye vsky's Les
Possedes,  and  that  October  purchased  a  house  in  Lourmarin,  a  small
village  in  the  south  of  France,  where  he  was  not  able  to  stay  for  an
extended  period of time until 1959, when he finally began work in earnest
on his long-planned novel Le Premier Homme.

The Notebooks  end in the last days of December  1959 with an eerily
final and personal entry, likely a draft of a letter to Catherin e Sellers,
which sees Camus  lamenting  the failures  of his intimate  relationships  and,
consequently , his life.

"The one who has conceived what is grand must also live it. "-Nietzsche.
Preface of E. and E.'
"... at this point in time I began to like the art of this violent  passion,
which  aging,  far from decreasing,  made increasingly  exclusive....  This
illness added other obstacles,  and the hardest  ones, to those that were my
own. But in the end, it has fostered this freedom  of heart, this slight
distance  with regard to human  interests,  which has always  kept me from
bitterness  and resentment.  Since I live in Paris, I know that this privilege
(because  it is one) is royal. But the fact is that I have enjoyed  it without
obstacles.  As a writer, I began to live in admiration  of what is, in a sense,
the terrestrial  paradise.  As a man, my passions  have never been `against.'
They have always  been addressed toward  things  bigger  or better than
myself."
Insanity  of the XXth century:  the most dissimilar  of minds confuse  the
taste for the absolute and the taste for logic. Parain and  Aragon.
June 11, 1951. Letter from Regine Junier2  telling me of her suicide.
The creator. His books enriched  him. But he does not like them and he
decides  to  write  his  masterpiece.  He  writes  it  alone  and  reworks  it
endlessly .  And  little  by  little,  embarrassment  then  misery  set  in.
Everything  collapses  and  he  lives  with  an  alarming  happiness.  The
children  are sick. He has to rent an apartment,  but live in only one part of
it. He writes.  His wife becomes  depressed.  The years pass, and in total
abandon,  he proceeds.  The children flee. The day his wife dies at the

hospital,  he  places  the  final  period,  and  what  should  announce  his
misfortune to him only makes him say , "Finally!"
Novel.  "His death was far from romantic.  They were put twelve in a
cell made for two. He choked  and fainted.  He died packed  against the
dirty  wall  while  the  others  straining  toward  the  window ,  turned  their
backs on him."
N.R.F. Curious milieu whose function  it is to create writers,  and where,
however , they lose the joy of writing and creating.
For her, happiness demands everything, even killing.
Naturalness is not a virtue that one has: it is acquired.
Response  to the question  about my ten favorite  words:  "World, pain,
earth, mother , men, desert, honor , poverty , summer , sea.

O light! In Greek tragedies,  this is the cry of those who are thrown
before death or terrible destiny .'
Man of 1950: he fornicated and read the newspapers.4
I have always  had the impression  of being on the high sea: threatened
in the middle of a royal happiness.
G. or the simulator: Believing  only in what is not of this world,  he
pretends  to be in reality. He plays the game, but openly, so that it is not
believed  that he plays it. He pretends twice. And once again: a part of him
really is attached to the flesh, to pleasures, to power .
The  acceptance   of  what  is-a  sign  of  strength?  No,  this  is  where
servitude  resides.  But the acceptance  of what has been. In the present,  the
struggle.

Truth is not a virtue, but a passion. It is never charitable.

pay - Remember , you know, she had a knack - And so on and so forth - In
other words . . . - You are being a fool (to her husband  who leaves without
a sweater).
Id. Augusta,  a civilian,  to whom a soldier, her adopted  godson  of war,
expresses  his gratitude  in these terms: "Mme.  Pellerin,  for me you were
worse  than  a  mother."  She  recounts  the  bombardment  of  Nantes.
Surprised  in the streets,  she sought  shelter  with a friend beneath  the ruins.
"I was wearing  a fox fur and a new outfit. When it was over, I was in
underwear ." Her friend disappeared  beneath  the ruins. "I pulled her by the
hair, only a few strands  remaining."  "In the meantime  my husband  was
behaving  in a perfectly  loving manner , not even wondering  if I came out
of the ruins....  The day before  I had an ID card made. I had checked  no
special indications.  The following day , I had a hangover ."

These are the atrocities  of Admiral  Kolchak7  who, according  to Victor
Serge,"  gave the Cheka  in the Russian  C.P. the advantage  over all those
who desired greater humanity .

1920.  Abolition   of  the  death  penalty.  In  the  night  precedi ng  the
promulgation  of  the  decree,  the  Cheka  massacred  the  prisoners.`'  The
penalty, by the way, was reestablished  a few months  later. Gorki:  "When
will we stop the killing and the bleeding?"
Victor Serge. "Everything  that was done in the U.S.S.R.  would  have
been done far better by a Soviet democracy ."
Preface  of E. and E.I  - My uncle - "Voltarian,  as one was in his time, he
professed  the  stiffest  contempt   for  men  in  general  and  his  bourgeois
clients  in particular . In satire and anathema,  he was sparkling . He had
character , too, and his compan y struck me as difficult. Now that he is
dead, I am bored in Paris when I think of him."
How the XXth century's  socialism expands  by war: The war of 1914
ignites  the revolution  of 1917. Foreign  wars, in addition  to the civil war in
China,  give us Mao Tse Toung - 1939 Sovietize  the Polish Ukraine and
Bielorussia,  the Baltic States,  and Bessarabia.  The war of 1941 - 45 brings
Russia  over the Elbe. The war against  Japan gives them Sakhalin,  the
Kuriles, North Korea.  Also watch Finland and South Korea.
Novel  character . Ravanel.2  Pure intelligence.  Accounts  of terrorism.
Mundane ennui. Militancy . Police.  Attorney . See new attorney above.
One  must  place  one's  principles  in  big  things.  For  the  small,
graciousness will suf fice.
The cynical and realistic  positions  make it possible  to reach a decision
and be contemptuous  about it. The others force us to seek understanding.
Hence the prestige of the first over the intellectuals.
We  work  in  our  time  without  hope  of  true  reward.  They  work
courageously for their personal eternity .
No matter what it claims,  the century  is in search of an aristocracy . But
it does not realize that for this it must renounce  the goal it so proudly
assigns  itself: well-being.  There is no aristocracy  without  sacrifice.  An

aristocrat  is, first, one who gives without  receiving,  one who obligates
oneself.  The Ancient Regime is dead for having for gotten this.
Wilde.'  He wanted to place art above all else. But the grandeur  of art is
not to rise above all. On the contrary, it must blend with all. Wilde finally
understood  this, thanks to sorrow. But it is the culpability  of this era that it
always  needed sorrow  and constraint  in order to catch a glimpse  of a truth
also found in happiness, when the heart is worthy . Servile century .
Id. There is not one talent for living and another  for creating.  The same
suffices  for  both. And  one  can  be  sure  that  the  talent  that  could  not
produce but an artificial work could not sustain but a frivolous life.
Novel. C. and her flowery dress. Evening prairies. Oblique light.
I  began  with  works  in  which  time  was  denied.  Little  by  little  I
rediscovered  the source  of time-and  maturing.  The work itself will be a
long maturing.
They wanted  to repudiate  beauty  and nature  simply  for the profit of
intelligence  and its conquering  powers.  Faust wanted  to have Euphorion
without  Helen.  The marvelous  child is no more than a deformed  monster ,
the homunculus  of a glass jar. In order for Euphorion  to be born, neither
Faust without Helen nor Helen without Faust.4
Revolt, true crucible of the gods. But it also forms idols.
Revolting  death. The history  of mankind  is the history  of the myths
with which it covers  up reality. For two centuries,  the disappearance  of
traditional  myths has shook history  as death has become  without  hope.
And yet there is no human  reality if in the end there is no acceptance  of
death  without  hope.  It  is  the  acceptance  of  this  limit,  without  blind
resignation, in the tension of all one's being that coincides with balance.
Novel.  A nice (lay. "Along  the Croisette,  she staggered  on her high
heels. She looked  at herself  in the mirror again and again before she left
the room. Of course  her soft flannel pants were a bit too tight. And her

hips were visibly wider than her shoulders.  So what, real women are that
way. Too much chest also, yet, this was not a problem,  and really, all in
all, it was more feminine.  These bodies  that were playing  volleyball  on
the beach, their lower halves  had to be observed  carefully  in order to
figure out whether they belonged to a man or a woman."
"The small black silhouette  paced before  the sea. Between  scarf and
sunglasses,  one could barely make out two lines drawn on by a paintbrush
in the spot where there had formerly been eyebrows,  and the white and
oily space of the forehead that tried in vain to frown at the sun's glare."
Short act about the seducer .
No, I don't drink water - Eat - I don't eat much. If I drink occasionally
it's because of hygiene.
What does love add to desire? One thing inestimable: friendship.
I don't seduce, I surrender .
Why women? I cannot  stand the company  of men. They flatter or they
judge. I can stand neither of the two.
At midnight,  nothing:  the commander  doesn't  come. The seducer  is sad.
He is leaving.  "Come  on," Anna says. "No, one cannot  be right and be
happy the same day . . ." (he changes  his mind).  "And yet if you are right,
there remains only happiness-ac tually there remains  nothing  but the love
in which you never believed,  never having  ceased  to believe  in your own
dreams  that you call God." He looks at her. "Then is this love, what I feel
rising  up  in  me?  -  It  is  undoubtedly  that.  But  gently  spread  apart
everything  that  remains  around  this  fragile  plant.  Gently,  gently  make
room for happiness at last."
Novel.  One of B's secrets  ... is that she could never accept nor stand, or
even forget, illness  or death. Hence, her major distraction.  She becomes

exhausted,  already having  to live alone like the others,  having  to simulate
the little nonchalance  and innocence  that is necessary  to continue  living.
But deep inside her she never forgets. She does not even have enough
innocence  for sin. Life for her is nothing  more than time, which itself is
disease  and death. She does not accept  time. She is engaged  in a battle
already  lost. When she gives up, she is there with the waves of water, with
the face of a drowned  girl. She is not of this world because  she refuses  it
with all her being. Everything starts from there.
Dordogne.'  Here  the  ground  is  pink,  pebbles  the  color  of  flesh,
mornings  red and crowned  by pure songs. A flower  dies in one day and is
already  reborn  beneath  the  oblique  sun.  In  the  night,  the  sleepy  carp
descend  the massive  river; ephemeral  torches  burn in the lamps on the
bridge,  leaving  a vibrant  plumage  on the hands and covering  the ground
with wings and wax from where will arise a fugitive  life. What dies here
cannot  pass. Asylum,  faithful  ground,  it is here that a traveler  must return,
in the house where hints and memories  are kept, and whatever  else in man
that does not die with him but is reborn in his sons.
It is not true that the heart wears out-but the body creates this illusion.
Those who prefer their principles  over their happiness,  they refuse to
be  happy  outside  the  conditions  they  seem  to  have  attached  to  their
happiness.  If they are happy by surprise,  they find themselves  disabled,
unhappy to be deprived of their unhappiness.
A tragedy about chastity .
Novel.  V. (and at the same time she was translating  my truth): I do not
desire  anything  other  than  what  I  have.  My  misfortune,  and  my
punishment, is to be unable to enjoy what I have.
Id. In adolescence  and even a long time afterward,  the only thing that
interested  him in love was the unknown,  hence knowledge.  And hence,
affairs.  But  an  affair  is  never  completely  sudden:  there  is  always  a
beginning,  no matter  how brief. Very often this beginning  was sufficient

for knowledge, when there was little to know, and he therefore  accepted
the liaison, certain that it would bring him nothing more.
Like this they confuse  love and knowledge,  those who have enough
arrogance  to believe  in self-suf ficiency , truly or falsely, for themselves.
Others  recognize  their limits, and their love is therefore  unique  because  it
demands everything, and being rather than knowledge.
Novel.  A.W., a young American  who came to Paris after having fought
in  the  war  (into  which  he  had  been  thrown,  a  happy  student  and

companion for life."

91. The countes s reports  that she cannot  get used to the count's  filth

"`Certainly ,' he says, 'I fear not being dead enough  in death and lacking
air in the ground. But I reason  with myself.  If I fear lacking  air, it is
because  I fear dying from it. There are two possibilities,  one where I will
not die from it and I will continue  to lack air but without  feeling  anguish.
Or I will die, and why the anguish then?"'

Mauriac.  Admirable  proof of the power  of his religion:  he arrives  at
charity  without  passing  by  generosity.  He  is  mistaken  to  continuously
send me back to Christ's  anguish. It seems to me that I have a higher
reverence  than he does, never having believed  myself  to be permitted  to
expose  the torment of my savior, twice a week, upon the first page of a
newspaper  for bankers.  He calls himself  a temperamental  writer. Indeed.
But he has an invincible  disposition in his temperament  to use the cross
like a missile.  Which  makes him a journalist  of the first order, and a writer
of the second. Dostoyevsky of the Gironde.
Novel.  "At  these  moments,  eyes  closed,  he  receives  the  shock  of
pleasure  like a sudden  collision  with a sailboat  in the fog, struck from hull
to keel, every part reverberating  with the shock, from deck to foresail, and
with the thousand  ropes and veins of the vessel's  extremities  trembling
until the moment it slowly turns over on its flank.  Then, the foundering."

Novel.  What struck him then was how few objects  there were in his
house.  The necessary-never  had a word been better illustrated.  When his
mother  lived in one of the rooms, she left no trace, except,  if anything,  a
handkerchief.
"I desired,  I called for the highest  sufferings,  certain  that from now on I

To  start  giving  is  to  condemn   oneself  for  not  giving  enough ,  even
though one gives everything.  And do we ever give everything-
Don't  ever  tell  a  man  that  he  is  dishonored.  Actions,  groups,
civilizations  can  be.  Not  the  individual.  For  if  he  does  not  have  the
awareness  of dishonor , he cannot  lose an honor that he has never had. And
if he has it, the terrible  burn that this represents  is like a red iron on wax.
People  melt, break beneath  the fire of an intolerable  pain in which they, at
the  same  time,  are  also  regenerated.  This  fire  is  that  of  honor  that
justifiably  resists and asserts  itself by the very limits of its pain. This is at
least  what  I  felt  the  day,  more  precisely  the  second,  when  after  a
misunderstanding  I believed  myself to be guilty of a truly low action.  It
was not true, but within that single second  I learned  to understand  all the
humiliated.
December  '51.
I await with patience a catastrophe that is slow in coming.
My  statements  on  the  radio  -  Listening  to  myself,  I  find  myself
exasperating.  Paris makes  me like this, despite  all my efforts. Since the
disappearance  of Combat,`'  I am too often continuously  lonely, having
nothing  to articulate,  defend,  expose, or even occasionally  justify. Never
having  been relieved by the warmth of others,  and by the spectacle  of
their generosity  even less, I finally freeze,  and in fact this frozen  voice
comes  to  me,  too  dismissive   to  really  express  condescension,  but

exasperating  to hear. If I felt true confidence,  for only one second, I would
laugh and everything would be settled.
I owe the idea I have of vulgarity  to some very bourgeois people, proud
of their culture  and of their privileges,  like Mauriac,  from the moment
they  display  the  spectacle  of  their  wounded  vanity.  They  then  try  to
wound  at the exact level where they were wounded,  and in that moment
discover  the exact height where they really are. Then, for the first time,
the virtue of humility  triumphs  over them. Poor little people,  indeed,  but
in spite.
I  was  never  very  submissive  to  the  world,  to  opinion.  Yet  I  was,
however , as little as it may have been. But I have just made the final
effort. I do believe  that in this regard, my freedom  is total. Free, therefore
benevolent.
I have the most dreadful opinion of myself, for days on end.

Man of Aran.'  The terrible life of these fishermen.  And far from feeling

Two o'clock  in the morning.  For years, two favorite  dreams,  one of
which,  in different forms,  is always of the execution.  Tonight,  awakened
suddenly , I can recall many of the details.
I walk in torment.  Scotto  Lavina  (a friend from Algiers  whom I very
rarely see, but like very much)  accompanies  me. He whispers  in my ear
(the group's pace quickens):  "My wife spoke to me yesterday  of X. and
X." And  I:  "No  proper  names,  above  all  no  proper  names."  He,  very
softly, as to a sick person,  "Oh! Forgive me." Someone  in the group (there
are guards whose presence  is not very noticeable  to me, and A., present
and absent in turn) asks me why and, reaching  the bottom  of an immense
staircase,  I say: "I want to remain  at the heart of the common  noun,"  a
sentence  that I repeat to myself,  with a sort of peace. My children4  are at
the top of the staircase,  which I climb, always  surrounded,  always  rapidly,
and hands bound, I believe.  (The idea, too, of being pushed,  all of us
pushed-we  all walk bent forward .) Jean moves toward  a corner, and while
looking  at him, I say: "And then it will begin again"  (but this feeling  is
not entirely in me, rather, like a sunrise,  it is a sort of delightful and
anguishing  discovery). I kiss them and, for the first time, cry. They say
goodbye  to me as usual, it seems. We leave the staircase  and pass by a
sort  of  railway  station,  which  I  exit  with  only  A.  and  Vera.  Vera
accompanies  me for a while-I  do not know her during  the dream, but
when I awaken  I think of her as of S. She is dressed  as a peasant,  vaguely
Central  European,  like  everyone  around  me.  The  scenery  is  modern:

railways,  construction  sites, the night filled with a light wind. Exiting  the
railway  station,  I move-decisively  still, and without  guards-toward  the
place of torment,  with an increased  anguish  which becomes  unbearable.
But I sense that Vera is carrying  a pistol, old style, which she had hidden
in the railway  station  (whose?).  As soon as I am sure of it, I cry out in joy.
"Ah! Vera I knew ... (insinuation:  that you would  do everything  that is
necessary  for this). How I love you." I take the pistol and the march
resumes.  We approach  a group of men who are working.  It seems to me
that I hesitate  some, as if I wanted  to wait longer, live longer. But the
others have passed  me a little. The pistol is too long and I have difficulty
straightening  it against  my temple.  I shoot rapidly, thinking  that I have not
said goodbye to A. nor to anyone  else. A terrible  burst in my head. And I
hear a sentence,  a sort of protestation  spoken  by one of the workers  (the
boss, I believe)  and whom  I have forgotten  at the moment  when this
dream ends.
Picaresque novel. Journalist - From  Africa to the entire world.
Play of love.
Your morals are not mine.  Your conscience is not mine anymore.
V. "If today one were to find a remedy  for death, I would not take it.
My pain (the death of his father and his mother)  my happiness  (his love)
has meaning only if I myself must also go there."
Emerson.  "Sometimes even the one who supported  these doctrines  (that
man has one soul) flees in the face of a journal  composed  in the night by
some dark scoundrel who knows not what he writes and drenches  his quill
in the mud and shadows."
Id. "What  is left for us if not to hold for certain  that it is by avoiding
lies and anger that we acquire the voice and language of man."
Id. "It is not with scruples  that a man grows tall. Like a beautiful  day,
height is given according to God's will."

Novel.  The train from St. Etienne-Dunieres  under the occupation,  one
winter  evening.  The  train  is  packed,  two  compartments  having  been
reserved  for  the  German  army.  Shortly  before  the  stop  at  Firminy ,  a
German  soldier  notices  that his bayonet  was stolen while he was in the
toilet. Howls of rage. Two workmen who were preparing  to get off and
return home at the end of their day are grabbed,  held in the corridor  while
the train departs.  They protest,  feebly, their innocence  obvious.  At the
following  stop, the soldiers  let them go. They are seen moving  away in
the frozen fog, resigned to the worst.
The witness also goes, unhappy . He cannot  follow  them. He does not
know  how  to  save  them.  He  spends  the  night  in  the  waiting  room,
thinking  of them. Nothing  to do but con tinue on so that this does not
happen again. But by then they will be beaten, and will possibly die.
Thoreau.  "As  long  as  a  man  remains  himself,  everything  is  in

According  to Emerson,  Americans  are prodigious  mechanics  because
they fear fatigue and pain: out of laziness.
Every writer, big or small, needs to say or write that the genius is
always  hissed  at  by  his  contemporaries.  Naturally ,  this  is  not  true,  it
happens  only occasionally  and often by chance.  But this need within  the
writer is enlightening.
Emerson  1848.  "How  then  did  we  manage  for  the  progress  of
mechanization  to serve everyon e, aside from the worker. He was fatally
wounded from this."
Id. "It is every man's right to see himself  judged  and characterized
according to his leading influence."
The Ancients  and the Classics  feminized  nature.  We entered  there. Our
painters virilize nature, and it enters into our eyes, pierces them even.
"No psychology  in art." "That's  what you're missing."  "Perhaps,  but
such is the law of creation:  make do with what you have. Then you will
have to judge not what I have, but what I have done."
To remain  a man in today's  world,  one must have not only unfailing
energy and unwavering intensity , one must also have a little luck.

Novel.  "It can now no longer be a question  of love between  us. It has
never been a question.  Deep down, I cried for years after your love - And
then I cried only after your attention. I obtained neither one nor the other ."
Play. D. Haughty , contemptuous, desperate, blunt.
G. is stopped  in his novel by the distraction  that his wife is causing
him. He comes  to Paris to work, but gets nowhere.  In truth, he does not
want to regain  the thread,  to hold on to the argument  and preserve  his
resentment intact.
He executed them with his own hands:  "`It is necessary ,' he said, `to
pay with one's own flesh.'"
To the few men who allowed  my admiration,  I owe a debt of gratitude,
the highest of my life.
Sexual  liberty has brought  us at least this: that chastity  and superiority
of will are now possible.  All the experiences,  the women  kept or free,
passionate  or  nonchalant,  and  he,  wild  or  circumspect,  exultant  or
incapable  of desire,  the circle is complete.  There is no more mystery or
inhibition.  Intellectual  freedom  is then almost  complete,  control  almost
always possible.

Deep inside me, the Spanish  solitude. Man does not escape  from it but
for a few "instants,"  then he returns  to his island.  Later (since 1939) I tried
to reconnect, I repeated  all the steps of the era. But double-time,  on the
wings of clamor, beneath  the lashes of wars and revolutions.  Today, I am
through-and  my solitude  overflows  with shadows  and works that belong
only to me.
Iguape.  A man at the front of the ferryboat.  The city, the procession.
The man and the stone collapse.  The visitor takes the stone but passes the

church  and walks toward  the river. He loads the stone onto a long rowboat
and rides up the river toward the primeval forest where he disappears.?
Even my death will be contested.  And yet what I desire most today is a
quiet death, which would bring peace to those whom I love.
One evening,  absently  turning  the pages of an agreeable  book, I read
without  reaction:  "As with many passionate  souls, the moment  had come
when his faith in life was faltering."  A second  later, the sentence  again
resounded in me, and I burst into tears.
A part of me has despised  this era without  measure.  Even amid my
worst failures,  I could never lose the taste of honor, and my heart has
often sunk before  the extreme  decay that this century  has reached.  But
another  part of me has wanted  to assume  the decay and the common
struggle....

They are rebellio n, pride, the inflexible  wall that is drawn up in front of

What is it then? One man is waiting  to see the most honest  newspaper
these times have known,  created  by the sacrifice  and labor of hundreds  of
men, he is waiting,  I say, for this newspaper  to pass into the hands of a
fly-by-night  financier, so that he can go lease his services  to this merchant
as soon as the free men have left the place.'  The other, at the same time in
which he supports  and applauds  his old friend against  me, writes to me
that one should  not believe  much of what is said by these old poets, and,
suddenly  frightened,  writes  again  to  beg  me  not  to  make  a  public
statement  about  his  letter  and  his  little  treason.  Yet  another  comes  to
solicit  my  services,  he  receives  them  and,  returning  to  his  home,
composes  an article that is insulting  to me and about which he writes to
me, incidentally , to soften the effect of it. Yet another , who fears being
judged  badly for having  long represented  a publisher  who abused  my

trust, asks to explain himself  before  me, receives  a letter that declines
purely  out of generosity  of not having  confused  him with his employer
and then, without  wasting  a second,  he grinds  out an essay explaining
how  he  is  saddened  that  moralists  of  my  kind  must  one  day  end  as
policemen.
They  are  our  champions,  our  cursed  withdrawn  beneath  the
comfortable  tents  of  maledicti on  which  they  do  not  leave  except  in
stealth.  It is they who ensure  our freedom  and who announce  that they
will hold the battle flag firm in the advancing  storm. Let us go, the first
strike from the policeman on duty will push them to their knees!
Fragment of a letter  on The Rebel.
We are very few. But truth comes before efficacy. We must define the
latter before worrying  about the former. What would be the use of being
millions  if the first commandment  of our "church"  were: You will lie?
This doesn't mean at all that efficacy has no significance.  It has a second
meaning.  The survival  of truth is a problem  no less important  than the
truth itself. It is a problem  that comes  later. That is all. Yet it must be
resolved.... Christians began by being twelve-Marxists two.
Letter to A. Maquet.
I advance  with the same steps, it seems to me, as an artist and as a man.
And this is not preconceived.  It is a faith I have, in all humility, in my
vocation....  My future books won't turn away from the problem  of the
hour. But I would like them to subjugate  it rather than be subjugated by it.
In other words,  I dream of a freer creation,  with the same contents.... Then
I will know if I am a true artist.
According  to Melville,  the remora,  a fish of the South Seas, swims
poorly.  That  is  why  their  only  chance  to  move  forward  consists  of
attaching  themselves to the back of a big fish. They then plunge a kind of
tube into the stomach  of a shark, where they suck up their nourishment,

and propagate without  doing anything,  living off the hunting  and efforts
of the beast.  These are the Parisian mores.
A certain race of men knows  with whom it can take it easy-primarily ,
those who practice  as much generosity  and loyalty  as they can-and  whom
decency inhibits from taking advantage of them.

3 gods in Eleusis: Iacchus, Demeter (the mother),  Trip- tolemus.6
Meaning:  death is not painful.  It is the terrestrial  life that is death;
death is liberation.
Rendition  in Luke: Let the deceased bury the deceased  and you go
announce the Kingdom of God.
1st Dionysus  will reconstitute  Pentheus7:
"Here is your God, rejoice,  but the only one worthy  of worshipping  me is
he who has demonstrated  that he won't ever succumb  to debauchery  of the
soul and of the body, to the false god who I am always  made to precede.
Wisdom now opens up to you.
- Ah! I burn to know it.
- Here it is: you have now won the right to madness...."

Pentheus and the Bacchantes howl endlessly as the curtain falls.
Also . . . "But wait until everyone quiets down.  Listen.  Everything
becomes  silent. It is now that you have the right to madness . For you
alone. In solitude. So that it kills only you."
Enter  Dionysus   II,  followed  by  Dionysus  I  disguised  as  a  skeptic
dilettante (Silene?) "Enjoy , enjoy!"
Debut: the old men run to the bacchantes.
A philosopher (Does he kill? How does he kill? Does one kill well, etc.
He  who  kills  so  well  and  I  who  reason  so  powerfully ....  We  will  do
wonders. I will lend him my reasoning and he will kill for me).
A poet.
A priest: what are you going to do with those?
A shopkeeper .
Nihilists.
Bacchante:  She wants to go there. Pentheus  is opposed  to it. "The city
must be maintained.  She does not have to be sacrificed  out of love." "She
does not have to sacrifice love."
Dionysus  I and Pentheus:  Who are you to proclaim  so much virtue. - I
have no virtue.  - Haven't  you coveted  women.  - Yes. - Haven't  you taken
them - Yes - Aren't you violent? (He hits him.)
Pentheus  is quartered.  Dionysus  II and the Bacchantes  celebrate  the
sacrifice.
Dionysus I arrives unexpectedly .
II - Who can silence the cries of madness?

I - The one who recognizes madness and keeps it controlled.
Id. A man like me, enslaved,  if you only knew the thoughts  he bears. I
have enough  rage to smack the gods' faces, enough  desire ... to force my
best friend's  wife....  But these dogs who run one after the other disgust
me, each one asking  for the desire of the other while only intending  to
relieve  his own desire.  Me, virtuous!  (He bursts out in laughter)  I would
like to be the one telling  the truth, but my blood is inflame d and my
intellect, having all the might, can conceive of all.
At the age of forty, one consents  to the annihilation  of a part of himself.
I wish the heavens would,  at the least, rectify  all of this unemployed  love
and make resplendent  the work for which,  at this moment,  I have no more
strength.
... Every man and woman  on me, to destroy  me, seeking  their share
without  respite,  without  ever, ever lending  a hand, coming  to my aid,
loving  me finally  for what I am so that I may remain  what I am. They
think my energy has no limits and that I should  distribute  it to them and
make them live. But I have put all my strength  in the exhaustin g passion
to create, and for the rest, I am the most deprived and needy of beings.
Novel.  "He had no more strength to love her. Alive in him was solely
the capacity  to suffer because  of her, the only thing remaining  of love
being deprivation  and want. She could no longer  give him anything  but
suffering. As for joy , it was dead."
Id. "One could believe  that she was all insubordination  and it is true
that this being, crowned  with flames,  burned  as rebellion  itself. But she
was above all acceptance.  I'll accept dying today (at age 30) since I've had
enough  joy. And if I were to live again, I would  want the same life,
despite its extreme misfortunes."
I don't believe  those who say we should  rush into pleasure  through
despair. True despair never leads to anything but sorrow or inertia.
Ah! well, here you are, a whore like the others.

Whoever  gives nothing  has nothing. The greatest  misfortune  is not to
be unloved, but not to love.8
Divided  between  a person  who refuses  death completely  and a person
who accepts it completely .
Too  many  white  cells,  not  enough  red  cells,  and  just  like  the  ones
eating the others, France  too is in a state of leukemia.  France  is no longer
in the position  of leading  a war nor producing  a revolution.  Reforms,  yes.
But it is a lie to promise France anything else. First refresh its blood.
Style. Prudence  before  rules. They are sometimes  like thunder:  they

Laghouat  and in front of the rock hill covered  in folded sheets of flint-
the vast expanse -night comes  like a black wave from the bottom  of the
horizon while the west turns red, turns pink, turns green.
The dogs of night untiring.
In the oasis, mud walls above which golden  fruits sparkle.  Silence and
solitude.  And then one emerges on a plaza. Swarms  of children  whirling
like little dervishes, laughing so all their teeth show .
Perhaps  it is time then to speak of the desert where I found the same
escape  - From the bottom  of the horizon.  ... I also wait to see the fabulous
beasts emerge and to find there, quite simply, a silence  no less fabulous
and this fascination....

- A little. I'm ashamed.
- Ah! You are rich!
- No, not very . But even when very poor , I've always lived richly .

A confused  mind.';  "Oh liars, oh liars! Me, I know him. He tripped  the
blind, called the beggars  filthy bums. He was nailed against  a wall, oh
liar, and the earth trembled.  It is a righteous  one that we killed." Morals
were safe. Here he is, head in the wall. When they nailed him up, there
was a nail in the wall behind  his head, and it entered,  like in mine now.
What mush! What mush! And then, finally, they cut out his tongue.  It is
after he had said, "Why have you abandoned  me?" They weren't  going to
let him continue,  no one was going to let him sit down at the table, make
confessions....
Hatred,  I've discovered  it. Hatred makes  me think of a mint lozenge,
mouth  frozen, stomach  slightly  burned.  One must be evil, one must be
evil. Me, I am a slave, it's under stood. But if I am evil, I am no more
enslaved. I spit over their kindness.

Finally he is crucified. Our father who is in ...

How to be forgiven, if one lies, since the other doesn't  even know there
is something  to forgive. One must therefore  tell the truth at least one time
before  dying-or  accept  dying without  ever being forgiven.  What death

lies and his crimes?

Novel.  "I  had  long  believed,   seeing  her  abandon,  that  we  were

I've  always  loved  the  sea  on  the  beaches.  And  then  the  shops
proliferated  on the deserted  beaches of my youth.  Now I love only the

greater  joy for me than to tread on the virgin sand in the clear light, full
with the whistling of waves.

her in the evening.
Indeed solitary from now on, but by my own fault.

We want to live our feelings  before putting  them to the test. We know
that they exist. Tradition  and our contemporaries  draw up incessant,  and
by the way fallacious, reports  for us. But then we live them by proxy. And
we use them up without having felt them.
Novel.  "Because  of the very same immense  wrong he was doing to her,
he searched  for every little occasion where she seemed  lacking  attention,
if not love. And then he would give her a hard time, not because  he could
ever  hope  to  alleviate  his  guilt,  but  to  drag  her  along  with  him  in  a
common  condition  and still make her live by his side, but this time on an
earth deserted and deprived of love."
The one thing that has always  saved me amid all my prostrations  is that

The tragedy  is not that we are alone, but that we cannot  be. At times I
would give anything  in the world to no longer be connected  by anything
to this universe  of men. But I am a part of this universe,  and the most
courageous thing to do is to accept it and the tragedy at the same time.

Men learn little by little to live. And I, for whom  life has been so
natural,  I've little by little unlearned  how to live until the moment where

Progress  of the material  condition  improves  more than necessary , and

Century  of serenity . The danger of catastrophe  is so widespread  at this
point that it blends  with the mortal  future of every condition.  This is why

From Laghouat  to Ghardaia.8  The daias and their ghostly  trees. The
tormented  Chebkas.  Kingdom  of  stones  that  burn  during  the  day  and
freeze at night-and  beneath  these terrible  weights  end up bursting into
sand. Even the cemetery  of Laghouat  is covered  with shards of schist, and
there the dead intermingle  beneath  the confusion  of stones.  Even these

meager  plowing s, which one occasionally  encounters  in the desert,  only
lead to finding  a certain  stone suitable  for construction.  When one plows
in this country , it is to gather  stones.  The soil is so precious  that one
scrapes  from it the few chips that accumulate  in the hollows  and then
carries  them in baskets  like the viaticum.  Water. Soil ground  to the bone,
to its schistose  skeleton.  Ghardaia and the Holy Cities in their circle of
ochre hills, themselves garnished with high red walls.
How  these  stones  in  the  desert,  suddenly  piled  one  atop  the  other,
hardly  different  from  other  accumulations,  teach  those  informed  by

February 15, 1953
Dear PB.7
I'll begin with the excuses  that I owe you for Friday. It was not because
of a lecture  on Holland,  but because  I was summoned  at the last moment
to sign books for the benefit  of those refugees.  This exercise,  which I was
doing for the first time, appeare d to me to be something  that I could not
refuse,  and I trusted that you would forgive me this snag. But this is not
the  question,  the  question  concerns  these  relationships  that  you  call
difficult. On this point, what I have to say is expressed  simply: if you
knew a quarter  of my life, and its obligations,  you would not have written
a single line of your letter. But you cannot  know it, and I neither  can nor
should  explain it to you. The "haughty  solitude,"  of which you, along with
many others who don't all have your virtues,  complain,  would be, after all,
if it existed,  a blessing  for me. But this paradise  is attributed  to me quite
mistakenly . The truth is that I contend  with time and people  every hour
that I work, most often without  accomplishing  anything.  I don't complain,
though.  My life is what I've made of it and I'm the first one responsible
for its dispersion  and rhythm.  But when I receive  a letter like yours, then
yes,  I  feel  like  complaining  or  at  least  asking  not  to  be  so  easily
condemned.  To appease  everybody today, I would  need three lives and
several  hearts, but I have only one, which can be judged  and which I often
judge to be of average  quality. I don't have the material  time, nor the inner
leisure  time, to see my friends  as often as I would like to (ask Char, whom
I love like a brother, how many times a month we see each other). I don't

have time to write for the reviews,  neither  on Jaspers  nor on Tunisia, not
even to clear up an argument  with Sartre.  You believe  me if you want to,
but I don't have the time, nor the inner leisure,  to be ill. When I am ill, my
life is turned upside down and I lag for weeks trying to catch up. But most
serious  of all is that I no longer have the time, nor the recreation,  to write
my books,  and I spend four years to write what, in freedom,  would have
cost me one or two. Incidentally , for some years now, my work has not
freed me, it has enslaved  me. And if I pursue  it, it is because  I prefer it
above all else, even freedom,  even wisdom  or true creativity , and even,
yes, even friendship.  It's true that I try to organize  myself,  to double my
strength  and  my  "presence"  by  utilizing  time,  organizing  my  days,
increasing  efficiency . I hope to be up to it, one day. For the moment,  I am
not-each  letter brings three others,  each person  ten, each book a hundred
letters and twenty  corresponden ts, while life continues,  and there is work,
those whom I love, and those who need me. Life continues  and, some
mornings,  tired of the noise, discouraged  by the interminable  work to be
done, sick of this crazy world which assails  you even as you pick up the
newspaper , finally sure that I will not be up to it and that I will disappoint
everyone,  I want only to sit and wait until evening  arrives.  I have this
desire, and sometimes I give in to it.
Can you understand  that, B.? Of course,  you deserve  to be respected
and spoken to. Of course your friends are as good as mine (who are not as
grammarian  as you believe).  Although  I have trouble  imagining  (and this
is not a pose) that my respect  could truly matter to someone,  it is true that
you  have  mine.  But  in  order  to  transform  this  respect  into  an  active
friendship,  a true inner leisure  would in fact be needed,  many meetings.  It
is the luck of my life that I have met many quality  people.  But it is not
possible  to have so many friends,  and unfortunately  this condem ns me to
disappoint,  I know. I understan d that this is intolerable  to others;  it is
intolerable  to me. But it is so, and if they cannot  love me like this, it is
normal  that they leave me to a solitude  that, you see, is not as haughty  as
you say .
In any case, I reply to your bitterness  without  bitterness.  Coming  from
someone  like you, letters like yours can only make me sad, and add to all

the reasons  I have to escape  from this city and from the life I lead here.
For the moment,  even though  this is what I want most in the world,  it is
not possible. Therefore  I must continue  this strange  existence,  and I have
to count whatever  you tell me as the price-a  little too expensive in my
opinion-that  I  have  to  pay  for  having  let  myself  be  driven  into  this
existence.
In any case, forgive me for having  disappointed  you, and believe  in my
faithful thoughts.

Nernesis.8  Sometimes  love kills with no justification  other than itself.
There is even a limit where loving a person  amounts  to killing  all others.
In certain ways, there is no love without  personal  and absolute  guilt. But
this guilt is solitary. Deprived  of the alibis of reason,  it is heavy to carry. It
is alone that one must decide  if he loves, and it is all alone that one must
respond  to  the  incalculable  consequences  of  true  love.  With  this
adventurous  solitude, man prefers  a tepid heart and ethic. He is afraid of
himself  and  for  himself.  He  wants  to  spare  himself,  refusing   then  his
condition.  And his first concern  is to seek a justification  which relieves  a
little of the weight  of his guilt. Since one must be guilty, at least he is not
guilty alone. Militant.

In love, hold on to what is.

Pasiphae  wants the bull by chastity . What it represents  is clean, sensual

pursued  for years in order to accomplish  an impossible  union. The bull is

Sex, strange, stranger, solitary , which without  stopping  is determined  to
move  forward,  irresistible  then,  it  must  be  followed  blindly  until,
suddenly , after years of furious passion,  before  more years of sensual
madness,  it  refuses  and  becomes  silent-thriving  in  routine,  becoming
impatient  with novelty , and not giving  in until the last minute  when one
consents  to gratify  it fully. Who, mildly  demanding,  could ever from the

For Nemesis. Paris, July 9, '53.
Dear Sir, I've taken time responding to your pleasant  letter. But these
last weeks passed for me like the wind. I, however , have been more than
sensitive  to your sympathy  and the manner  in which you wish to clearly
express  it to me. I had liked the veiled luster of your poems,  their "lagoon
and sun" aspect.  And I am happy to sense, moreover , your accord.
Excess  in love, indeed  the only desirable,  belongs  to saints. Societies,
they exude excess only in hatred. This is why one must preach  to them an
intransigent  moderation.  Excess,  madness,  ruin,  they  are  secrets,  and
risks, for some, and one must say nothing  of them or, at most, barely
suggest.
For this reason  poetry  is the eternal  nutrient.  One must entrust  it to
guard the secrets.  As for us, who write in the language  of all, we must
know that there are two kinds of wisdom,  and sometimes  pretend to be
unaware  that  one  is  higher.  Accept  all  my  best  wishes  and  cordial
greetings.
If I have always  refused  to lie (unfit even when I made an effort) it is
because  I could never accept  solitude.  But solitude  should  now also be
accepted.

Like after a long illness when someone  whom you love dies. And even
though  there was nothing  to do but wait, it is as though  one had struggled
long and hard, and then all of a sudden, defeat.
For certain  men it requires  more courage  to face a simple  street fight

What  they  prefer,  what  makes  them  tender  and  melancholy ,  what

The result is that we no longer  need to preserve  in ourselves  a force of

If concern for duty diminishes,  it is because  there are fewer and fewer

Nihilism.  Little  demolishing  dunces,  contentious,  thinking  of
everything  in order to deny all, feeling  nothing  and relying  on others-

All their effort is to discourage  one from being. To prevent  the writer

Cf. p. :354: the power  of Society  has limits.  It has acquired  solely

But  finally  it  was  necessary   to  nourish  the  enormous  starving

through sterility .
France,  which  had  the  audacity  and  genius  to  produce  that
extraordinary  French Revolution , is at the same time the country  that has
yielded the least, out of disquiet, to the madness of production.
Ferrero.  "One  of  these  days  the  act  of  restrained  will  is  going  to
explode."
With certain  people  we maintai n the rapport  of truth. With others,  the
rapport of lies.  The latter are not the least durable.
Novel.  "I have nothing  to do close to you. I did not love you enough
and you did not love me enough  for me to set tle my final accounts  with
you. I must manage  alone and die alone. I waited  for years for you to
forgive my faults and accept me as I was. You never did. I therefore kept
my faults, I remained  guilty, and today I must put myself  in order with
these faults alone. Leave me.

Forgive me, then, the pain that I have caused  you. And if you can,
forgive me from the bottom  of your heart. That is what I need most,
though,  the privation  that for years has prevented  me from living. If your
heart remembers  nothing  but the love it has for me, this would  be the
salvation in death that I could not have in life."

"It must always  be rued that, instead of bending  the nobility  under the
influence  of law, it was uprooted  and cut down. By doing so they have . . .
inflicted on freedom a wound which will never heal."
"Democratic  societies that are not free can be rich, refined,  gentle,  even
magnificent,  powerful  by the weight  of their bourgeois mass; they can
encounter  private  virtues  there, good family  fathers,  honest  merchants,
and quite estimable landlords  ... but what will never be seen in similar
societies,  I dare to say, are great citizens  and, above all, a great populace,

and I do not fear to affirm that the common  level of hearts and minds will
never cease to lower itself as long as equality  and despotism  are joined
there."
Id. for our progressives.  "We have seen men who thought  to atone for
their  servility  toward  the  lowest  officials  of  political  power  by  their
insolence  toward God, and who, while they abandoned  all that was most
free,  most  noble,  most  proud  in  the  doctrines  of  the  Revolution,  still
flattered  themselves to have remained  faithful  to its spirit while remaining
irreligious."

sadness  of  the  hour,  G.  enters  the  church  and  prays,  he,  the  declared
atheist  (prays to Mary, I believe). And he reemerges. Every time he had
tried to write this moment  of abandonment  or of cowardice  (he says he
does not know which it is) he could not, or dared not.
Roger Martin du Gard and his mother's  death. They hide her cancer
from her. They change  the labels of the medications,  etc. But after her
death,  the  memory  of  this  terrible  agony  pursues  M.  du  G.  who  tells
himself  he will not be able to bear it. The only possible  hope would be to
kill himself. But will he have the courage?  He attempts  it, goes through
several  "rehearsals"  with a revolver , but at the last moment  (pressing  on
the trigger)  he feels his courage  lacking.  Thus the anguish  grows,  he feels
stuck, until he finds the "way." He takes a taxi, brings the revolver  to his
forehead.  "When I arrive at the level of the third lamppost,  I will press on
the trigger." He gets to the third lamppost  and feels ready to press on in
this manner . Consequently , an immense feeling of freedom.
The  same  person  tells  me  that  he  suffers  from  wanting  nothing
anymore,  not even to live (see his letter).  The anorexia  about which Gide
spoke. In Nice, suddenly  a hope. He sees a sign for "Bouillabaisse"  at the
door of a restaurant  and wants to have some. It is his first want in months.

He enters, eats with joy. Since then, nothing  more. He is in the waiting
room when he writes to me.
Of all the men I have met, he is the most human,  which is to say the
most worthy of tenderness.
Stendhal.  "What  is  the  self?  I  know  nothing  of  it.  One  day  I  am
awakened  on this Earth, I find myself  tied to my body, to a character, to a
fortune.  Shall I vainly enjoy myself  by trying to change  these things,  all
the while forgetting  to live. Deception!  I subject  myself  to their defects.  I
subject  myself  to my aristocrat ic tendencies  after having  railed for ten
years, and in good faith, against any aristocracy ."
L'Impromptu des Philosophes2  as commedia dell'arte.
A "modern" title:  The Hatred of  Art.
Write  naturally .  Publish  naturally  and  pay  the  price  for  all  this,
naturally .
Criticism  is to the creator  what the merchant  is to the produce r. Thus,
the commercial  age sees an asphyxiating  multiplication  of commentators,
intermediaries,  between  the producer  and the public.  Thus, it is not that
we are lacking  creators  today, it is that there are too many commentators
who drown the exquisite and elusive fish in their muddy waters.
Novel.  See Weissberg's notes.3  At the interroga tion, the chekists  put a
golden  paper  crown  decorated   with  swastikas  on  his  head,  a  large
swastika on his chest, and then they hit him.
Id. The old anarchist tailor explains  his point of view clearly. The judge
insults  him: "You have offended  me, your honor, I will not answer  any
more of your questions."  Record  of the interrogation:  thirty-one  days and
thirty-one nights. Madhouse!
Novel.  1st part. Search  for a father or the unknown  father. Poverty  does
not have a past. "Day in the provincial  cemetery . . . . X. discovered  that

his father had died at a younger age than he himself  was at that very
moment  ... that the person  lying there had already  been his junior for 2
years, even though  he was 35 years old when he was laid there....  He
realized he knew nothing of this father and decided to look for him4  . . . "
Birth during relocation.
2nd part. Childhood (or weave this with the first part)  Who am I?
3rd part. The education  of a man. Incapable  of tearing  himself  away
from bodies. Ah! The innocence  of first acts! But the years pass, people
bond and each act of the flesh binds, prostitutes, engages more and more.
He does not want to be judged  (to tell the truth, he judges  little) but
there is no way to avoid it.
Two characters:
1) The indifferent one: raised without  a familial  environment.  Without
a father. A single mother. He manages  alone. A little haughty , although
polite.  Always  walks alone. Goes to boxing  and soccer  matches. Likes
only the peak moment.  Forgets the rest. At the same time begs of others
the tenderness  of which he is incapable.  Lies easily but has terrible urges
to tell the truth. A little monstrous. Secrecy  until the end, because  he
forgets major parts of his life, since few things interest  him - An artist by
his very shortcomings.
2) The other , sensitive and generous.
They meet. at the end (and it is the same) next to the mother .
O father! I have searched  madly for this father whom I never had and
here I discovered  what I have always  had: my mother  and her silence. The
five movements of Mozart's Quintet in G Minor .
Love and Paris.  Algeria. "W e did not know love."

Id.  Poor  childhood.  Life  without  love  (not  without  pleasures).  The
mother  is not a source  of love. Consequently , what takes longest  in the
world is learning to love.
Two people  are brought  together  purely by looks (let's say the cashier
and the custome r). When the opportunity  presents  itself, they tackle each
other. What does he say?  "Do you have time?"  What does she say, how
does she respond?
"I'll say that I went somewhere."
In two forces of equal tension,  progress  is an optimum  balance.  It takes
account  of the limits and subjugates  them to a greater  good. And not in a
vertical arrow , which would suppose that progress is limitless.
Play. We wait for him. He returns  from the camp. He speaks  the truth
about love (because he has failed: he now knows what a man is).
Scene with his wife, and in front of her, Philinte  and G., Philinte's  wife.
"For example,  I slept with G.... Moreover , I am not sure that you and
Philinte."  - Philinte:  "No. It's not that G. is not delectable.  And although  I
do not like the truth, I will speak it by way of exception.  When I saw that
you and G...." - "How"  - "Yes, I knew it. From that moment  everything
became  impossible  between  your wife and me. So finally  this continual
coming  and going-ugh!  You agree with me don't you? Then come for
dinner  tomorro w?  G.  will  make  her  chaud-froid5  for  you.  She  is
unbeatable when it comes to chaud-froid." End of the act.
But your feelings? - Well what about my feelings?  They existed like all
things,  intermittingly  - And the rest of the time? - I was lying, of course.  -
I preferred your lie - Of course,  you've  always  loved napping  - But you're
a monster! -  And you, my angel?
Id. For example,  my son is an imbecile  - Ah! that, the son says - You
see.  You  protest.  It's  the  reaction  of  an  imbecile.  An  intelligent  man
always  admits  the  possibility-I   should  say  the  probability-of  being  an
imbecile  in some ways. Thus my son is an imbecile  (he looks at him). Not

completely , however. Rather, he plays stupid.  He is cunning  and he knows
that stupidity  has its advantages,  that it is the hearth around  which society
warms itself.
Id. The son becomes  social.  "When  the social plan coincides  with the
private  plan . . . - Your mother will become  intelligent?  No, but ... One
does not covet another's  wife? - Surely - Why, yours will be perfect'?  - No
... - You, I see you coming.  You want to use the social force of others to
sort out the small problems  of your private  life. Leave that, my boy. The
misery  of others is their private  life. They will sort out this little affair,
nothing to fear . But don't touch.  Ali! don't touch.
Id. But he falls in love with Dominique.  And again he lies.
The intellectual who asks for giveness.
"Worst was the Gospel.  Yes, I read the Gospel,  initially  because  I only
had that in hand and then because I realized  by its usage that there were
more common  points between  Jesus and me than between  a policeman
and me. And today's  world is composed  for the three-quarters  that are po-
licenien or for the policemen's admirers."
A man whose  life is full refuses many advances.  Then, for the same
reason,  he forgets his refusal.  But those advances  were made by people
whose  lives were not full and who, for this same reason,  remember . The
first later finds he has en- enmies  and is astonished  by it. Like this, almost
all artists imagine  they were persecuted.  But no, one responded  to  their
refusal  and one punished  them for their excess  of riches.  There is no
injustice.6
The First Man
Plan?
1) Search for a father .

2) Childhood.
3)  The  years  of  happiness  (sick  in  1938).  Action  as  a  happy
overabundance. Powerful feeling of liberation when it's over .
4)  War  and  resistance  (Bir  Hakeirn  and  the  alternative  clandestine
newspaper).
5) Women.
6) Mother .
The indifferent one. A complet e man. A high-caliber  mind, a skillful
body broken  by pleasures.  He refuses  to be loved out of impatience,  and
out of the exact feeling  of what he is. Sweet and kind in illegitimacy .
Cynical and terrible in virtue.
He can do anything  because  he has decided  to kill himself.  Cyanide.
Thus he enters the resistance,  whence  extraordinary  audacity . But the day
when he has to help himself to the cyanide, he abstains from it.
The First Man
Search for a father .
The hospital. The mother  (and this paper from the town hall which is
brought  to the two illiterate  women  peeling  potatoes  on the floor; he must
help the deputy  mayor in and hand him the paper so that he can read it),
the press, Cher-  agas,7  etc. He sees the father begin to take shape. Then
everything fades. Ultimately there is nothing.
It is always so on this earth, where there are 50, 70 years ...1 1
At 40, Maillol`'  meets V. B., a Jewish  Romanian  painter  who took
refuge  at Collioure  in order to elude the Germans.  He meets him in the
street, recognizes  the painter  in him, invites  him to come show him his

pictures.  The following  day V.B. goes, is received  with open arms, and
explains  his situation.  "This house is yours,"  M. says, his only response.
He provides  a cup of coffee. He opens the carton while smiling  at V.B.
and finally  looks at the first picture,  distinctly  surrealist:  A woman  who
ends as a tree. Maillol  bursts out: "No, no, not that, it's not possible.  Out
of here!"
Nietzsche. "They all talk about me.... But none think about me."
Le  Pilot-i.  "He  must  be  blamed.  It  is  necessary  to  blame  his  ugly
manner  of  appearing  honest  and  not  being  so."  In  the  first  person.
Incapable of loving, he forces himself to, etc.
What the collaborationist  left approves  of, passes  over in silence  or
considers inevitable; in no particular order:
1) The deportation of tens of thousands of Greek children.
2) The physical disposal of the Russian peasant class.
3) The millions of people in concentration camps.
4) The political abductions.
5) The near daily political executions behind the iron curtain.
6) Anti-Semitism.
7) Stupidity .
8) Cruelty .
The list is open. But, this is enough for me.
Tolstoy's Journal.  Three demons:
1) the play (possible struggle)

2) sensuality (very dif ficult struggle)
3) vanity (the most terrible of all).
"`I consider,' he says in a letter to his aunt, `that without  religion  man
can be neither good nor happy .... But I do not believe."'
Id. "The truth is horrible."
October  '53. Noble trade where one must, without  budging,  let oneself
be insulted  by a lackey  of letters or of the party! In other times, which
were  said  to  be  degrading,  one  at  least  retained  the  right  to  provoke
without  ridicule  and to kill. Idiotic,  for sure, but this made the insult less
comfortable.
There are people  whose religion  consists  of always  forgiving offenses,
but who never forget them. For me, I don't have what it takes to forgive
the offense, but I always for get it.'
Those who have been fertilized  both by Dostoyevsky  and Tolstoy, who
understand  both of them equally, with the same facility, these sorts are
always formidable to themselves and to others.
October  '53. Publication  of Actuelles  11.2  The inventory is complete-

Shortly  after great historical  crises one finds oneself  as dissatisfied  and
sick as on the morning  following  a night of excess.  But there is no aspirin

It is said that Nietzsche,  after breaking  with Lou, entered  into a final
solitude,  walked  at  night  in  the  mountains  that  dominate  the  Gulf  of
Genoa  and lit immense  fires there that he watched  smolder . I've often
thought  of  these  fires  and  their  gleam  has  danced  behind  my  entire

intellectual  life.  So  even  though  I've  sometimes  been  unjust  toward
certain  thoughts  and  certain  men  whom  I've  met  in  this  century ,  it  is
because  I've unwillingly  put them in front of these fires and they were
promptly reduced to ashes.
In a letter to Hawthorne,  Melville speaks  of Moby Dick: "Here is the
book's secret epigraph: Ego non baptiso to in nominee ..."
Id.  "When  I  was  writing  this  book  I  was  aware  of  an  allegorical
construction  on which the entire book, as well as each one of its parts,
rested."
Id.  After  having  finished  M.B.  and  having  read  Hawthorne's
appreciative  letter:  "I  experien ce  a  strange  feeling  of  satisfaction  and
irresponsibility; no desire for debauchery ."
And then "I feel that I will leave this world with less bitterness  after
having known you."
Cf. The theme of the story "The Happy  Failure"~3:  praise God for this

Nietzsche. One could classify religious men as top-notch artists.
Nietzsche:  Dawn.  "Never  keep silent, never conceal  what one can think
against  your own thoughts.  Swear it solemnly . It is the first act of loyalty
that you owe to your thought."
Beyond  ...: "If one has character , one has in his life a characteristic
experience  that eternally  recurs."  Question  then: to find the event and give
it its name.
Genealogy  ...: "Whoever  has ever built a new heaven  has found the
necessary power for this endeavor only at the bottom of his own hell."
"Polyphony" of certain natures.

Nietzsche  (Human,  All Too Human):  "A little while after I fell ill, more
than ill, tired by the continual  disillusion  caused  by all that enthused  us
modern men ..."
... "Here a man who speaks  suffers and is deprived,  but he expresses
himself as if he did not suf fer and did not deprive himself."
... "From now on solitary , I take the side against  myself  and everything
that, in fact, opposed me and made me suf fer."
Unique and gigantic goal: the recognition of truth.
Eternal  recurrence:  Exalt what is and adore that it returns.  (Without
metaphysics, it indeed remains only that.)
Note to Lou (1882). "In bed.  Acute crisis. I despise life."
Necessity  of an aristocracy . In the present,  one can imagine  only two of
them: the one of intelligence  and the one of work. But intellige nce alone
is not an aristocr acy. Nor work (the examples,  in both cases, are obvious).
Aristocracy  is not primarily  the enjoyment  of certain  rights, but primarily
the  acceptance  of  certain  duties  that  alone  legitimize  the  rights.  The
aristocracy  is asserting  itself and at the same time stepping  aside. To leave
oneself  (the  definition  of  duty),  intelligence  cannot  move  toward
privileges.  Some  take  part  of  intelligence,  others  are  the  opposite  of
intelligence.  And  duty  consists  neither  of  asserting  oneself  nor  of
suppressing  oneself  but of making  sure one serves what one claims.  Thus,
intelligence  can move only toward  the work that is its duty and its limit.
Work,  for  its  part,  cannot  move  toward  stultification,  unconscious  or
conscious  (generalized  humiliation  of intelligence),  which is either itself
or  its  opposite   (see  above).  Thus,  work  can  only  move  toward
intelligence.  Finally,  in  the  present,  the  aristocracies  of  work  and
intelligence  are not possible  until they recognize  one another  and begin to
walk one toward  the other in order to one day establish  a single superior
image of man.
Obligation to hide a part of his life gave him the appearance of virtue.

The only source  of aristocracy  is the people.  Between  the two there's
nothing.  This nothing,  which for 150 years has been the bourgeoisie,  tries
to give shape to the world and obtains  nil, a chaos that survives  only
because of its past roots.
Walpole. "His good sense went as far as genius."
Utilize his vices, be wary of his virtues.
Brupbacher .4  "Nobody  should produce  more philanthropy  nor morality
than he naturally  secretes."  He thought  that the mission  of the militant
philosopher consisted of supporting all factors of freedom in all classes.
W. Whitman.  "When  liberty  goes out of a place, it is not the first thing
to go. It waits for all the rest to go, it is the very last."
Van Gogh, stuck with a common woman,  Christine,  then abandoned
her when she was in the maternity  ward. Gau guin, waking  in the night,
saw Van Gogh leaning  over him and looking  at him fixedly. At the Saint-
Remy asylum, the count of G. beats his chest with a piece of wood while
repeating: "my mistress, my mistress!"
Salacrou,5  in  the  notes  that  accompany  his  Theatre,  Volume  VI,
recounts  the  following  story:  "A  little  girl  about  to  turn  10  declares:
`When  I grow up, I'll register  with the cruelest  party.' Questioned, she
explains:  `If my party is in power, I'll have nothing  to fear and if it is the
other, I'll suffer less since the party which will persecute  me will be the
less cruel one.'" I don't much believe in this little girl's story. But I know
this  reasoning  very  well.  It's  the  shameful,  but  effective  reasoning  of
1954's French intellectuals.
Dostoyevsky's  father made him whip both the peasants  who bowed to
him and those who did not bow to him. In both cases they appeared,
according  to him, audacious.''  After the wife whom he tormented  dies, he
gets drunk at night and talks to her, taking in turn a woman's  voice and
then  a  man's  voice.  He  is  murdered.  Head  shattered,  genitals  crushed

between  two stones.  Two months later, D., who hated his father, sees an
interment, collapses, and groans.

The Russian's  hatred  for the form that limits.  They have pushed the
revolution  to its end. Berdyaev 8  notes somewher e that they have never

absence  of  chivalry  has  had  disastrous  consequences  for  the  Russian
moral culture.
Carlyle,  Nietzsche,  Dostoyevsky , are they revolutionaries?  They are
called counterrevolutionaries, though.
Adaptation of  The Possessed.
Cf.  Berdyaev .  "Shatov ,  Verkhovensky ,  Kirilov,  these  are  the  many
disaggregated  fragments  of  Stavrogin's  personality ,  emanations  of  this
extraordinary  personality  that  becomes  exhausted  as  it  dissipates.  The
enigma  of Stavrogin,  the secret of Stavrogin,  such is the unique  theme of
The Possessed."
Dostoyevsky's  Thesis:  The same paths that lead the individual  to crime
lead the society to revolution.
Verkhovensky:  "The  most  important  force  of  the  revolution  is  the
shame of having one's own opinion."
Cf. Guardini,9  pp. 40-41 and 202.

At the request  of Massignon,  I write to the President  of the Republic  to

The School of Critics: the "laws" of the theatre.
- If I have understood  well, Sir, I must follow with punctuality  the laws
that neither  Aeschylus,  nor Shakespeare,  nor Calderon,  nor Corneille,  nor
any  of  the  other  great  dramatic  geniuses  could  keep  themselves  from
breaking.
- It would be more accurate  to say that only Shakespeare,  Aeschylus,
and the others could allow themselves to break these laws.
- By taking your advice,  though, I will be neither  one of these great
creators.
- Would you claim to be?
- To be, no. But to become.  And if not, why write? I will fail, that is
almost  certain.  But to have tried, it will give to my life a taste that you
strip away from me in advance.  And Shakespeare,  after all, was born from
a hundred pretentious  and desperate fools who wanted  to be Shakespeare.

According  to our existentialists , every man is responsible  for what he
is. What can possibly explain  the total disappearance  of compassion  in
their universe of pushy old men. Yet they claim to fight against  social
injustice.  Then there are people  who are not responsible  for what they are;
the cur is innocent  of his misery. So? the disabled,  the ugly, the timid. . . .
And to conclude, compassion, again?

When  they  spoke  of  me  as  a  "director"  (somebody  who,  in  short,

Thermonuclear  bomb: to some extent,  generalized  death coincides  with

infinity, we begin again at zero. 2nd displacement  of the problem:  the
universal  curse no longer  has God as author, but men. Men have finally
become  equals with God, but only in his cruelty. We must therefore  begin
again  the  revolt  of  ancient  times,  but  this  time  against  humanity .  We

Nobody  deserves  to  be  loved-nobody  measures  up  to  that
immeasurable gift.  Those who receive love then discover injustice.
If I had not given in to my passions  perhaps  I would have had the tools
to intervene in the world,  to change  something.  But I have given in to
them and this is why I am an artist, and this alone.
Somebody  inside of me has always  tried, with all his strength,  to be
nobody .
At the boundary  of this long burning  thought,  far off in the distance,
total acceptance.
At the very moment  when after so much effort I laid down the limits,
believing  to be able to reconcile  the irreconcilable,  the limits burst and I
was hurried into a silent unhappiness.

Mahler's  4th  symphony  in  G  major  for  sopranos  and  orchestra.  At
times, Mahler, by contrast,  makes  one appreciate  Wagner, showing  how
much  the  latter  remained  master  of  his  fog.  Other  times,  Mahler  is
excellent.

X. says to me: "Why don't we accept the idea of eternal  life? Because  it
is, in the end, a private  beatitude  of consciousness-and  we want to be,
which is to say we want to know that we are. But then why reproach the
world for precisely what gives us consciousness,  which is to say pain and
suffering (this is indeed  the contradiction  of modern  atheism).  Me, I have
always  accepted  suffering with a sort of joy, the joy of being." I say to
him that therein  lies the genius.  The genius?  Yes, the genius of life, which
she alone, among all the beings I have met, carries with natural pride.

It is easier for intellectuals  to say no than to say yes. At the end of his
life,  looking  at  volumes  of  his  work,  Doctor  Reclus,  who  sided  with
Dreyfus,  realized  that there were two years when he produced  nothing.
Ah! yes, Dreyfus: he devoted  those two years to studying  files of the
affair. Today one takes a side based on a single reading  of an article.2

Terrible  morning.  Afternoon  exhibition  of Cezanne:  the first mad and

required  the terrible  discipline  that Cezanne  had. The demented  alone are
classic  because  they are that or nothing.  C. pushed  demand  to the limit of
his disorder and chose still-life  and landscape  painting  because  he found
in them an architecture,  a geometry . Toward the end he returned  to bodies

Action  and writing:  they are not certain  about being right, but this
uncertainty  gives them a guilty conscience.  They write then to get rid of
this guilty conscience.  With this intention  they will seek new arguments,
which they will find, and then assert a little further. The opposition  will do
the same. Thus, the positions  will stiffen. So many repeated  assertions
will  be  equivalent  to  actions.  Will  soon  provoke  them.  Thus,  the
victorious  party will have enough  charges on the day of victory. By means
of continually fleeing  their guilty consciences,  the losers will have found
true guilt and will answer  for it, never having  wanted  that. Another day,
the victors, in turn, will be vanquished  and will respond,  never having
wanted that. History is a long crime perpetrated by the innocent.

For X. (and her family)  love mixes with suffering,  anguish.  To love is

plunged into guilt and could no longer truly love.

The opposite of reaction  is not revolution,  but creation.  The world is in
an unending  state of reaction  and thus unendingly  in danger  of revolution.
What defines  progress,  if it is such, is that without  compromise,  creators
of all kinds triumph  over the mind, over reaction,  and over inactivity
without  revolution  being  necessary. When  there  are  no  more  of  these
creators, revolution is inevitable.

I often read that I am atheistic;  I hear people  speak of my atheism.  Yet

Pavese:  "We are idiots. The little bit of freedom  that the government

Rembrandt:  glory until 1642, at 36 years of age. From this date on, the
march  of  solitude  and  poverty.  An  infrequent  experience  and  more
significant  than  the  banal  one  of  the  ignored  artist.  About  such  an
experience, nothing has been said.
B.C.: "Nature  does not give this spiritual  force to man so that he can

The literature  of totalitarian  countries  does not die so much because  it

Arrival  in Turin this morning.5  For several  days, joy at the thought  of
rediscovering  Italy. I have not seen it since my last stay in 1938. The war,
the  resistance,  Combat,  and  all  these  years  of  revolting  seriousness.
Travels,  but instructive  and where the heart falls silent. It seemed  to me
that my youth,  a renewed  strength, and a lost light awaited  me in Italy.
Also, I was going to flee this universe (my home),  which for a year now
has destroyed me cell by cell; perhaps  this escape  would save me forever.
Actually , yesterday  when the train started  moving,  I was no happier . Tired
at first, and then there was the meeting  with Grenier  where I wished we
could have spoken  freely, but we could not; even X. could not help me to
leave contented.  During  the night, however , between  brief slumbers,  a
happiness came, yet still remote.

At 7 o' clock this morning,  the realization  that we are in Italy. I shake
myself  and open the blind: a landscape  covered  in snow and fog. It is
snowing  over all of northern  Italy. Alone in my compartment,  a laughing
fit took hold of me. It is not cold. Yet I.A., who waits for me at the train
station,  claims  she is freezing  to death. With her pretty, wavering  French
and  her  small,  calm,  gracious   gestures  (she  reminds  me  of  Maman),
blushed  from the cold like a little snow flower, she returns  a little bit of
Italy to me. Already  the Italians  on the train, and soon those of the hotel as
well, have warmed my heart. People whom I have always  liked and who
make me feel my exile in the French people's perpetual bad mood.
From my hotel room I can see the snow continue  to fall over Turin.
Still I laugh at my disillusion. But courage returns to me.
Turin beneath the snow and fog. At the Egyptian  gallery, the mummies,
which have been pulled  from the sand without  wrappings,  shrivel  from
the cold. I like the grand streets,  paved and well spaced.  This city is built
as much of space as of walls. I am going to see the house at 6 Piazza
Carlo Alberto,  where Nietzsche  worked  before  plunging  into madness.  I
have never been able to read the account  of Overbeck's  arrival without
crying:  his entrance  into the room where Nietzsche,  insane  now, raves,
and then crying,  throws  himself  into Overbeck's  arms. In front of the
house I tried to think of he whom I have always  loved with as much
affection  as admiration,  but it was in vain. I find him better in the city-
which I understa nd he loved, despite the low sky-and  I understa nd why he
loved it.
Short Story. The camp prisoners  elect a pope, choosing  from those
among  them who have suffered most, denying  the other-the Roman-who
lives in the luxurious  Vatican.  They call theirs Father  even though  he is
one of the youngest  there, they obey him in all, and will die for him until
he himself  dies defending  his sons (or better yet he refuses  to die and
protects  himself  because  he  has  others  to  defend  and  this  is  the
beginning).6
November  25.

Grey  misty  day.  I  wander  in  Turin.  Crowned  skulls  on  the  hill.
Downtown,  at the heart of an immense  view, bronze  horses rise up in the
fog. Turin, a city of horses  frozen  in the same elan in the place where
Nietzsche  became insane,  stopped  a horse from being beaten by its driver,
and then madly embraced its muzzle. Dinner -villa Camerana.
November  26.
Long walk in the hills of Turin. In the surrounding  sky, the snowy Alps
appear  and disappear in the fog. The air is fresh, humid,  and smells  like
autumn.  The city below is covered  in fog. Far from everything,  tired, and
strangely happy . Evening, lecture.

November  27.
Depart  for Genoa  in the mornin g with I.A.; strange  little being, clean,
rich in heart and will, with a sort of reflective  renouncement  that seems
surprising  for such a young person.  She wants to "laugh  and regret."  In
the case of religion,  she believes in "detached  love." Obviously  many
aspects  of Maman,  whom  I dream  of with sadness.  I always  have this
grave, unbelievable death on my heart....
Rain  and  fog  all  over  Piedmont  and  Liguria.  In  the  middle  of  the
snowfields,  we cross the mountains bordering  the Ligurian  coast. Four
tunnels  later and the snow disappears  whereas  the rain redoubles on the
slopes  descending  toward  the  sea.  Two  hours  after  arrival,  a  lecture.
Dinner  at  the  Palais  Doria.  The  old  marquise  appears  emaciated,
everything  except her eyes and heart. As I leave, I walk in a Genoa finally
rediscovered,  washed  by voluminous  waters.  Black and white marbles
shine, lights fuse in the streets, lar ge arteries, banal.
From the VIth century  to the year 1800, the population  of Europe never

million!

Long walk in Genoa. A fascinating  city and quite similar  to the one I
remembered.`'  Superb  monume nts erupt in a tight corset of small streets
crawling  with life. Beauty  is made on the spot here, radiating  in the life of
everyday . A singer on the corner  of the street improvises  the scandals  of
current events.  A singing newspaper .
The small cloister of San Matteo. The wind drives the rain in bursts
across  the large leaves  of medlar trees. Brief instant  of happiness.  Life
must now be changed.
Evening:  departure for Milan,  in the rain. Arrived  in the rain. What

Sleepless night.

Finally, in the morning,  pale but determined  sunshine  over the Roman
countryside.  Stupidly , tears come to my eyes. Rome. Another  one of these
luxurious  hotels,  stupid  like the society  that maintains  them. I'll move
tomorrow . With N., I look at the Birth of Venus. Walk along the villas
Borghese and Pincio:  everything  is painted  on the sky with a brush of rare
bristles.  I sleep. Last lecture.  Free at last.  Dinner  with N., Silone,2  and
Carlo Levi.3  Tomorrow will be good.
December  1st to the 3rd.
There are cities like Florence,  small Tuscan or Spanish  cities, which
carry the traveler , support  his every step, and render  those steps lighter.
Others,  like New York, weigh on his shoulders  and crush him such that he
must learn little by little to stand up and to see.
This is how Rome weighs,  but with a sensitive  and light weight:  one
carries  it on the heart like a corpus of fountains,  gardens,  and cupolas,  one
breathes  beneath  it,  a  little  oppressed  but  strangely  happy.  This  is  a
relatively  small city, but from an aerial perspective  it occasionally  breaks
out at the turning  of a street, this sensitive  and limited  space breathes
together with the traveler and lives with him.
Left the hotel for lodgings  on the Villa Borghese. I have a balcony  that
extends  over the gardens,  and the view I found there warms  my heart
every time I see it. After so many years of a city without  light, of rising in
the fog, among  the walls, I am ceaselessly  nourished  by this sky and these
lines of trees that extend  from Porta Pinciana  to Trinity dei Monti and
behind which Rome rolls out its cupolas and disorder .

Each morning  when I go out on this balcony , still a little drunk with
sleep, the birds' song surprises  me, comes to find me at the bottom  of my
slumber , and comes to touch a precise place that in a single stroke releases
a sort of mysterious  joy. For two days the weather  has been nice and the
beautiful  December  light before me outlines  the curled-up  cypresses  and
pines.
Here I regret the dark and derisory years I have lived in Paris. There is
a reason  of heart that I no longer want because  it is useful to no one and
puts me a hair's breadth from my own loss.
The day before yesterday , on the Forum-in  the part that is badly ruined
(close to the Coliseum),  not in this extravagant  flea market  of pretentious
columns  found under Campidoglio-then  on the admirable  Palatine  Hill
where nothing  exhausts  the silence, the peace, the world always emerging
and always perfect,  I began to rediscover  myself.  It is this that the great
images  of  the  past  serve,  when  nature  can  accommodate  them  and
extinguish  the sound that lies dormant  in them, to gather the hearts and
forces that will then better serve the present  and the future.  It is felt on the
Via Appia where,  even though  I arrived  at the end of the afternoon,  I felt
inside of me, while I was walking,  a heart so full that life could have left
me then. But I knew that it would continue,  that there is a force in me that
moves forward,  and that this stopover  would yet serve progress.  (One year
I did not work, I could not work even though  ten topics were waiting,
which I know were exceptional  and I still could not tackle.  About a year
since, and I have not gone insane.)  One could live well in this cloister , this
room where  Tasso4  died.
Places in Rome.  Piazza  Navona . Sant' Ignazio  and the others.  They are
yellow. The fountain  basins are a little pink beneath  the baroque  gushing
of water and stones.  When one has beheld  all, or beheld  in any case all
that one could behold,  strolling  without  seeking  knowledge  is a perfect
happiness.
Yesterday , during the night, in front of San Pietro in Montorio,  Rome,
beneath  its fires, was like a harbor whose restlessness  and noise had come

to die at the foot of this silent embankment where we were.
It's  a  strange  and  insufferable  certainty  to  know  that  monumental
beauty  always supposes  servitude,  that, however , servitude  is beauty  and
one  cannot  help  but  desire  beauty  and  one  cannot,  desire  servitude;
servitude  remains no less intolerable. Perhaps  it's for this that I put the
beauty  of a landscape  above all else-it's  not paid for by any injustice  and
my heart is free there.
December  3.
Superb  morning  in the Villa Borghese. The light of Algerian  mornings
flows between  fine pine needles  and carves them out one by one. And in
the Gallery ,5  full with a fairblond light, Bernini  amuses  me, gorgeous and
disconcerting  when  grace  triumphs,  as  it  does  in  the  highly  surrealist
Apollo  and Daphne  (as an art, surrealism  was initially  a counterof fensive
to the baroque),  hideous  when grace disappears,  as in the disconcerting
Truth Unveiled by  Time. A vibrant painter also (Portraits).
Correggio's  Danae,  and especially  Venus Blindfolding  Cupid,  by Titian,
painted at age 90 and of timeless youth.
The Caravaggios,  not those in St. Louis of the French,6  seen in the
afternoon,  definitely  superb  with the contrast  of  the violence and the mute
layer of light. Before Rembrand t. Especially  The Calling  of St. Matthew:
superb.  C.7  points out to me the constancy  of the themes  of youth and
maturity .  Moravia"  had  already  spoken  to  me  of  the  type  of  man
Caravaggio  had been: he committed several  crimes,  was robbed  fleeing
Tuscany, and then was thrown  on a beach where he died, insane (1573-
1610). Moravia also told me the true story of Cenci,`'  on whom he wants
to base a play. Beatrice  is buried  beneath  the altar of St. Louis of the
French.  Riots  in  Rome,  the  French  Revolution.  A  French  sans-culotte
painter  takes  part  in  sacking  St.  Louis  of  the  French.  The  tombs  are
opened.  Beatrice's  skeleton  is there, the skull split, resting  in the center of

the body. The painter  takes the skull and leaves,  playing  with it like a ball.
This is the last image related to the terrible story of Beatrice Cenci.
At  the  end  of  the  afternoon,  I  return  to  Janiculum.  San  Pietro  in
Montorio.  Yes, this hill is my favorite  place in Rome.  High in the tender
sky, groups of starlings,  light as smoke,  turn in all directions,  crossing
each other, scattering, and then gathering  to plunge  over the pines, which
they graze before returning  to the sky. When we go back down with N.,
we find them exhausted  in the trees, the plane trees of Trastevere's  Viale
del  Re,  their  numbers  so  enormous  that  each  tree  hums  and  crackles,
covered  with more birds than leaves.  When evening  falls, a deafening
chirping  covers  the noises of this populated  neighborhood,  merges with
the  sputtering  trolleys,  and  keeps  all  of  the  laughing  heads  turned  up
toward these enormous swarms of leaves and feathers.
The  large  brown  Roman  with  the  gentle  and  noble  face,  with  a
demeanor  so simple  and so proud, takes care of me at the lodging house.
Short story . Love with the painter . And all the nobility on his side.

December  4.
Morning.  Barberini Palace.  Caravaggio's  Narcissus,  and especia lly this
Madonna  attributed  to P. della Francesca,  appears  to me to belong  rather
to the wispier manner of Signorelli.  Admirable in any case.
Lunch with Moravia and N. at Tivoli, and a long afternoon  in Hadrian's
Villa, the perfect  location.  Superb  day, it's true, free of clouds  and with a
round  sky  whose  sections  disperse  an  even  amount  of  light  on  the
magnificent  cypresses and the tall pines of the villa. Its sections  of tall,
ruined  wall receive  this even light on their honeycomb  sheathing and in
turn let escape  secretions  of honeyed light from their cement  hives. Here,
I can better see the difference  between  Roman  light and others,  that of
Florence  for example,  more diffuse, silvery, spiritual,  in short. Rome's
light, on the contrary , is round,  gleaming,  and supple.  It makes one think

of  bodies,  with  the  opulence  of  felicitous  flesh,  the  successful  life.
Backgrounds  even more succulent.  Birdsong  among  the ruins. In the face
of this curious and happy perfection, the feeling that all is said.
Dinner, Piovene.1  At the conclusion  of thirty conversations,  I begin to
get an idea of the true situation  here. Not of opinions  but of factions.  Few
liberals, misery , its purpose, and little by little a certain inertia.
At  forty  years  of  age,  one  no  longer  complains  of  the  bad,  one
recognizes  it and struggles  according  to what one owes. One can then
occupy oneself with creating without for getting anything.
In The Last Judgment's moveme nt of ascension,  on the right side of the
altar, Michelangelo's  bodies had to be heavily  muscled  in order to give the
impression  of irresistible  lightness.  Light yet heavy. This is the intricacy
of art.
In the Bor gia apartments, Pinturicchio's Rhetoric carries a sword.
One's heart aches a little at the thought  that Julius II destroyed  Piero
della Francesca's  (and others)  frescoes  so that Raphael  could paint his
chambers; what have they paid for the superb Liberation of St. Peter?
Caravaggio's  Deposition  from  the  Cross.  The  Cross  is  not  seen;
definitely an exceptional painter .

Departing  with Nicola  and Francesco.  The Roman  countryside.  F. is so
beautiful  and so removed  from everything  without  ceasing  to be present
and human. The village  of Circe.2  Arrival  in Naples. Lunch in Pozzuoli at
a restaurant that is Padovani's  twin. It is pouring  rain in Naples, which
increases my fever . In the evening the sky clears.
December  8.
I awaken  with a serious  fever. Last night I could not finish these notes.
Despite  that, a long walk in the "Barrios"  behind  the rue Santa Lucia.
These are the slums behind  the Champs-Elysees.  The door is open and
one sees three children  in the same bed, occasionally  with their father, not
at all embarrassed  to let themselves  be exposed.  All of this flapping linen
gives Naples an air of perpetual  festivity  that comes,  after all, from what
the linen lacks and from the need to wash it day after day. These are the
flags of misery. N.F. tonight.  Then we leave in a damp carriage  that smells
of leather and dung. The friendships  of men always  taste good. N. takes
us to a neighborhood  in Porta Capuana.  Main street climbs  upward.  On
every balcony lamps are posed with their lampshades,  and this gives to
that misery  an extraordinarily  festive  air. There is a kind of procession  in
front of the church.  Flags wave above the packed  crowd that tramples  in
the  thick  mud  of  cabbage  debris  left  by  the  morning  market.  And
especially  the firecrackers  in all the saints' behinds;  the Virgin announces
herself  by  backfiring.  In  one  window,  a  demented  person,  eyes  fixed,
ignites  dozens of firecrackers  with the same mechanical  gestureone  after
the  other-which  he  then  hurls  into  the  crowd  and  around  which  the
children  dance in a ring, like the Sioux,  until they explode.  The hostelry
of the poor . They have outdone themselves.  This is the Escurial of misery .
December  8.

In bed all day with a fever that won't let up. Ultimately  I will not be
able to go to Paestum.  Return  to Rome at the first sign of improvement,
then Paris, that's all. There's  something  between  the Greek temples  and
me: at the last moment  something  always  intervenes  that prevents  me
from going to them.'
Incidentally , this time there is no mystery . This exhausting  year has
brought  me  to  my  knees.  The  hope  of  recovering  my  strength  and
returning  to work was purely  sentimental.  Instead  of running  toward  a
light that I can barely taste, I would do better, after all, to spend a year
rebuilding  my health and willpower . But for that I would  have to free
myself  a little from all that weighs  down on me. Those are the thoughts  of
bed and fever and of a traveler  cloistered  with Naples  surroun ding him.
But they are true thoughts. Fortunately , I see the sea from my bed.
F's  painter  friend,  extremely  ignorant  and  having  to  illustrate  the
Passion  of St. Matthew  for a radio program,  makes a saint surrounded by
pretty women and mocking angels.
I)ereniber 9.
Upon waking,  the fever has disappeared.  But stiff in the joints and
punch-drunk.  However, I decide  to go (as every time, I draw energy from
recognizing  worse  situations:  prisoners,  etc.).  We  leave  in  a  beautiful
sunshine.  Sorrento (and the delectable Cocumella  garden),  Amalfi a little
too decorative  where we lunch, then I drive to relieve  F. who is tired, and
the sun sets when, after having  crossed  an industrial  region  and then a
curious  ground  that makes  me think of Limbo  (large reeds, skeletal  and
bare), we arrive at Paestum. Here the heart falls silent.
(Later.) At the end of the afternoon,  I want to try to relive this arrival.
We are welcomed  at an inn close to the ruins by a nice old room with
three  beds  and  enormous  bleached  walls,  rustic  but  of  unquestionable
cleanliness.  A dog sticks close to me. The sun sets as, the gates being
closed,  we climb the ramparts  to enter the field of ruins. Light still comes

from the quite close blue sea, but the hills that face the sea are already
black. When we arrive before the temple  of Poseidon  the already  sleeping
crows  rise  up  in  an  extraordinary  tumult  of  wings  and  cries,  then  fly
around  the temple,  fall to the four corners  and set out again like a salute to
the  admirable  being  of  stone,  nonetheless  alive  and  unforgettable,
appearing  before our eyes. The hour, the black flight of crows,  the birds'
rare songs, the space between  the sea and the hills, and one retains  these
exact and warm wonders;  all of this in my fatigue  and emotion  puts me a
hair's  breadth  away  from  tears.  Then  the  interminable  rapture,  when
everything falls silent.
Evening,  silence,  crows,  like the birds of Lourmarin  and the cat, my
tears, music.
In  the  morning,  in  Tipasa,  there  is  dew  on  the  ruins.  The  world's
youngest  freshness on what is most ancient.  Therein  lies my faith and, in
my opinion, the principle of art and life.
December  10.
Last night, walk toward  the beach,  among  the reeds, ramparts,  and
buffaloes.  The immense  and muted sound of the sea, which intensifies
little by little. The beach, tepid water under the night's  grey and luminous
sky. On the way back it rains a little and the sound of the sea dies down
behind  us. The buffaloes move gently, lowering  their heads,  still as the
night. Gentleness.
I fall asleep after having  gazed through  my window  at the temples in
the night. The room with the thick and naked walls that I like so much is
freezing  cold. Cold all night. I open my windows;  it is raining  on the
ruins. An hour later, at the time we are to leave, the sky is blue, the light
fresh  and  magnificent.  Endless  amazement  before  this  temple  of
enormous  sponge  pink columns , golden  cork, its ethereal  impression,  its
inexhaustible  presence.  Other birds have mixed  with the crows but the
latter still cover the temple  with a black veil flapping  in all directions,

emitting  raucous  cries. The fresh smell of the small heliotropes,  which
cover the temple's surroundings.
Noises: the sound of water , dogs, a distant  Vespa.
It is not the melancholy  of ruined  things that breaks  the heart, but the
desperate love of what lasts eternally in eternal youth: love of the future.
Still in the ruins between  the hills and the sea. Difficult to pull myself
away from these places,  the first since Tipasa where I have known  an
abandonment of all being.
December  10.
Follow-up.  We  leave,  nevertheless,  and  a  few  hours  later,  Pompeii.
Interested  of  course,  but  never  touched.  The  Romans  are  sometimes
refined,  never civilized.  Lawyers and soldiers  whom  we confuse,  God
knows  why, with the Greeks.  They are the first, the true burglars of the
Greek mind. Alas, conquered  Greece  did not conquer  them in turn. Even
though  they borrowed the themes  and forms of the grand art, they never
understood  the cold approximat ions that they would have been better off
not  making,  such  that  the  Greek  naivete  and  splendor  would  have
appeared  to us without  interme diary. Compared  with Hera of Paestum's
temple,  all the antiquity  that covers  Rome and Italy shatters  to pieces and
with  it  a  comedy  of  false  grandeur .  By  instinct,  my  heart  has  always
known  this, my heart which has never beaten for a single Latin poem (not
even Virgil is admired,  nor loved)  and which has always  ached for the
flash of a tragic stanza or lyric hailing from Greece.
Returning  to this precious  Buchenwald  that is Pompeii,  the taste of ash
and fatigue  grows.  We drive, alternating  with F., and at 9:00 P.M. I arrive
in Rome exhausted.
December  11.

Almost  the  entire  day  in  bed.  Continuous  state  of  fever  makes
everything  taste bland to me. Regain health at all cost. I need my strength.
I do not need life to be easy for me but I want to be able to match myself
up to it if it is difficult, being in command  of whether  I want to go where I
am going.  Will leave  Tuesday.
December  12
A  newspaper  falls  into  my  hands.  The  Parisian  comedy  that  I  had
forgotten.  The joke of Goncour t. This time, The Mandarins.4  It appears
that I am the hero. In fact, the author has taken a situation  (the director  of
a  newspaper  originally  from  the  Resistance)  and  all  the  rest  is  false:
thoughts,  feelings, and actions.  Better:  the questionable  acts of Sartre's
life  are  liberally  heaped  on  my  back.  Garbage  anyway .  But  not
intentionally , just sort of as one breathes.
Improved  state. Grey day. It rains on Rome whose wellwashed  cupolas
sparkle slightly . Lunch at F .G. Evening, alone, fever past.
December  13.
More Caravaggio.  Santa Maria del Popolo.  Rome's  sadness  is also with
its streets,  which are too high and too tight. This is why places there are so
beautiful:  they deliver;  the baroque  then triumphs  over the Roman.  Like
its Roman  couples  frozen  in stone who have nothing  in common  except
that they stand very straight.  The twilight  hour that slips into the palace
and  collapses  the  proud  facade.  In  the  evening  M.  talks  to  me  about
Brancati5  and his death. Dinner alone.
December  14. Departur e.
Existentialism.  When they accuse  themselves  one can be sure that it is
always to crush others. Judge-penitents.6

With  Luke  true  treason  begins,  causing  the  disappearance  of  Jesus'
desperate dying cries.
M., to whom I say that there are certain  roles that ask of the actor only
virtuosity  and  in  which  the  actor  can  experience  his  metier  and  his
mastery , tells me that this does not interest  her, that she does not like to
play characters  she cannot  marry and live and feel herself  then living
another  life through.  And she concludes:  "I like to perform  because  I am
romantic."
Morals. Not to take what one does not desire (dif ficult).?
I have always  hoped to become  better. I have always  decided  to do
whatever  is  necessary  to  this  end. Whether  I  have  actually  done  it  is
another question.
For me, was marriage  not a more civilized  sensual  adventure?  It was
that.
If I bloom, she wilts. She cannot  live without  leaning  on my blossom.
Thus, we are two opposing poles of psychology .
The opposite  of the subterranean  man: the man without  resentment.  But
the catastrophe is the same.
This world wiggles quite a bit because,  like a cut worm,  it has lost its
head. It searches for its aristocrats.
La Martiniere, the white boat that transported  the prisoners  to Cayenne-
and  made  a  stopover  in  Algiers  to  load  new  cargo  on  board  (my
reportage"  on  a  day  of  pouring  rain-the   boat  covered  with  shaven
convicts-the  interior, two cages, etc. - The same trip that I made but in a
comfortable cabin) -  A story?
The First Man. Ambition  made him laugh. He did not want to have, he
did not want to possess, he wanted to be. For that only obstinacy .

From the moment  the private  life is thrown  on display, explained  to so
many people, it becomes  the public life, and it is vain to hope to maintain
it.
This life (empty) of cities and unbearable days without love.
For ten years it is what has interested  me more than anything  else in the
world.
The First Mau. "And thinking  of all that he had done without really
wanting  to, that others had wanted-or , more simply, because  in similar
circumstances  others had done things this way-all  of which nonetheless
accumulated  in the end to form a life, the one he shared with all men who
ultimately  die  without  having  known  how  to  live  the  life  they  really
wanted to live."
The  First  Mail.  Theme  of  energy.  "I  will  conquer ,  but  without
compromising.  Compromise,  hypocrisy , base desire of power, all of that is
too  easy.  But  I  will  truly  dominate,  without  making  a  movement  to
possess or to have."
The only law of being is to be and to transcend oneself.
.Ionas.  The  concier ge  beside  herself  (her  son  died):  "Ah!  Monsieur
Jonas,  you  understand,  don't  you!"  and  then  immediately  afterward:
"Don't go see Monsieur Jonas, he beats his wife and children."
The First Matt.  Theme of friendship.
M., without much culture  and entering  full-on  into the masterworks.
Incapable  of  dawdling  with  mediocrity ,  even  out  of  laziness,  and
discerning greatness by instinct.
The  First  Man. Theme  of  anguish.  (cf.  Connaissance  de  l'homme.`'
Adler p. 156). Character  motivation:  desire for power, psychologically
speaking.

Don Faust (or Doctor  Tenorio):  "I never asked anything  for what I
gave, I never spoke of what I did, I considered  myself  too small for never
having  given quite enough,  and I thought  mainly  of all that I'd never
given. But today I need the little that I've done; I need those who are here.
Those to whom I've never refused  my hand nor my help, they who speak
and testify in my favor. All are silent. Then it is I who will speak. This one
. . ." (rebellious text).
First Man. With Simone.  For one year, he cannot  take it. And then
avoidance. She cries and this triggers everything.
Everything  comes from my congenital  inability  to be bourgeois and a
contented  bourgeois.  The  smallest  appearance  of  stability  in  my  life
terrifies me.
In the end, my greatest  advantage  over the disingenuous  is that I am
not afraid to die. I hold horror and distaste  for death, but I am not afraid to
die.
Treason  of the left-wing  intellectuals.  If their true goal is to preserve
the u.s.s.i .'s revolutionary  principles  while progressively  correcting  its
perversions,  what reason would the Russian  government  have to renounce
its totalitarian methods  if it knows in advance  that they will always  be
excused?  In truth, only the frank opposition  of the West's leftists  can make
this government  reconsider , assuming  it can or wants to. But in truth our
intellectuals' treason is still explained by something other than stupidity .
Why weakness  in the face of pleasure would be guiltier  than weakness
in the face of pain. Weakness  is sometimes  responsible  for incomparable
devastation.
Don Faust. 1st scene or prologue  - Faust asks to know all and have all.
"Thus,  I will give you seduction,"  the devil says. And Faust becomes Don
Juan.
Last scene. He has to pay. "Let's go." No, the devil says, he must come
against  his  will,  otherwise  he  dies  simply.  "Die  simply  then"  (here  a

chorus of men welcome the hero among them - Better late than never).
Russia  and the communists'  insular  complex  (Cf. Adler: Connaissance

In N.R.F.: dialogues  (answers,  questions)  or an imaginary  letter'  out of
Actuelles.
Novel.  "This evening  did not go well-at  the concert  he applauded  after
the third movement  thinking  that the symphony  was finished.  But the
vigorous  and  reproachful  hush  taught  him  that  there  were  four
movements.  And the looks of his neighbors,  heavy with recent ecstasy  and
sudden scorn, still pursued him."
One of the short stories in the French style (Jonas).
Flooding  of the Seine. During  the night, a noise from the river, never
heard.
Don Juan. The atheistic  moralist  finds faith. Consequently  everything
is allowed since someone  can absolve  what men cannot  pardon.  Hence,
generous libertinism crowned with vibrant faith.
The taste of creation  is so strong  that those who are incapab le of it
choose  Communism,  which  assures  them  of  an  entirely  collective
creation.

Arrival  in Algiers.  From above, in a plane that runs parallel  to the
coast, the city looks like a handful of glittering  stones thrown  along the

sea. The Hotel St. Georges' garden.  O welcoming  night toward which I
finally return and which faithfully receives me as in days gone by .
February 18.
Beauty  of Algiers  in  the  morning.  Jasmine  in  St.  Georges'  garden.
Inhaling  the scent fills me with joy, with youth. Descent  on the city, cool,
airy. The glittering sea from afar . Happiness.
Francois'  death, crippled.  Sent back home from the clinic with tongue

And you in what year?
I don't know . Look at my family record book.
Well, his family  abandoned  him. At what age'? - I don't know. Oh! he
was young.  His sister left him. How old was his sister?  I don't know. -
And his brothers?  He was the youngest-no,  the second.  - But then his

brothers  were too young to take care of him. - Yes, that must be why. -
Then, they couldn't have done otherwise.

streaming light, cool on the damp ruins. Same emotion, always new .
How lucky to be born into the world on the hills of Tipasa and not at St
Etienne or Roubaix.  To know my luck and receive it with gratitude.

Radiant  day.  In  the  distance  the  sea  and  sky  glitter,  evenly  mixed

Departure  from Paris.7  Heartbroken  and emptied  of any joy by X. The
Alps. And the islands that come one by one to meet us on the sea: Corsica,
Sardinia,  in the distance  Elba and Calabria.  Cephalonia  and Ithaca are
almost  invisible   in  the  twilight.  Then  the  Greek  coast,  but  at  night,
Peloponnesus's  muscular  hand becomes  a dark and mysterious  continent,

covered  with snowdrop,  where here and there the snow-covered  peaks
shine. A few stars in the still illuminated  sky and then a crescent moon.
Athens.
27.
Awakening,  wind, clouds,  and sun. Some errands.  My charming  21-
year-old translat or, with a youthful  glow (I told you I was close to the
hotel but that was not true, and I ran the whole way so as not. to be late,
which is why I am out of breath), who wins me over and whom I adopt.
Acropolis.  The wind has cleared  all the clouds,  and the whitest,  most
natural  light falls from the sky. All morning,  the strange  feeling of having
been  here  for  years,  moreover ,  of  being  at  home,  without  even  being
bothered  by the language  differences.  While climbing  the Acropolis,  this
impression  increases when I notice that I go there "as a neighbo r" without
an emotion.
Up there it's another thing. Over the temples  and the ground stone,
which the wind seems to have also stripped  to the bone, the eleven  o'
clock  light  falls  fully,  bounces,  shatters  into  thousands  of  white  and
searing  swords.  The  light  digs  into  the  eyes,  causes  them  to  well  up,
enters the body with a painful  speed, empties  it, opens it to a sort of full
physical violation, cleanses it at the same time.
Helped  by habit, the eyes open little by little and the extravagant  (yes,
it's what strikes  me there, the extraordinary  audacity  of this classicism)
beauty  of the place is received  in a purified  being, cleaned  with the light's
cresol.
Then the dark red poppies  I have never seen before,  one of which
grows directly  on a bare stone, alone, the [...],8  the mauves,  and marked
by the perfect  vantage point, space all the way to the sea. And the face of
the second Kore statue on the Erechtheion, the bent leg of the third ...

Here one fights against  the idea that perfection  was reached  then and
that the world has not. ceased  to decline  since. But this idea ends up
crushing  the heart. It is again, and always,  necessary  to fight against  it.
We want to live and to believe that is to die.
Afternoon, Hymettus, a violet color . Penteli.
7 p.m. Lecture. Dinner at a taverna in the old quarter .
28.
Morning.  With  Margarita  Liberaki.9  Daphni.  But  Byzantium,
definitely .... The place is charming. In Eleusis  one must have a lot of
imagination.  But the fields before and after Eleusis  are quite beautiful.  In
the temple, two paths lead to the sanctuary  and the second  is deviated
such that everything is out of the view of the uninitiated.
Vital importance of what I know of Eleusis.  To develop.
Admirable pieces at the museum.
Lunch at the embassy . Tiempo perdido.'
Afternoon.  Agora.  Theseion.  Areopagus;  in Agora's  small  museum,
statues  of  Herakleion,  Athena,  Hercules.  Hercules  is  knotty  and  hard
beneath  the flowery  honeysuckle s that cover him. Then I go up on the Hill
of the Muses.  The sun, low on the horizon,  is not yet the red color that
will draw it perfectly  in the clear sky. But it is no longer intense: it wanes
and loses its form. Then from its broken  circumference  escapes a subtle
honey that, spreads  throughout  the sky, gilds the hills and the Acropolis,
and covers the scattered  city blocks with a soft and unique  splendor which
reaches out to the four corners of the horizon, all the way to the sea.
I return just in time for my controversial  lecture.  After two hours of
answering  questions,  I leave fatigued.  Dinner  in Piraeus  with Margarita

Liberaki.  Curious being: secretive  and grim with sudden  bursts of life and
laughter .
29.
Morning.  National Museum.  It contains  all the world's  beauty. I knew
the Kore statues  were going to touch me, but the wonderment  with which
they've  left me lasts still. I am allowed  to visit the cellars  where they kept
some  of  them  during  the  war  to  protect  them  from  the  invasion  and
destruction.  And there, in the cellar where history  has thrown  them, they
still smile under the dust and straw that covers  them, and this smile, over
twenty-five  centuries,  still  warms,  informs,  and  encourages.   Funerary
steles,  too,  and  repressed  grief.  On  a  black  and  white  lekythos,  the
inconsolable  dead cannot  resign themselves  to never seeing  the sun and
sea again. I leave unhappy and a little drunk with this perfection.
Then I leave for Sounion.  The midday  light is still slightly  shrouded,
carrying  an invisible  mist in the air, but I admire  the space and vastness  of
these landscapes,  however  reduced. As we approach  Sounion  the light
becomes  fresh and youthful.  Then on the cape, at the foot of the temple,
there is nothing  but wind. The temple itself leaves me cold. This marble,
too white, has the appearance  of stucco.  But the promontory-where  it rises
and moves into the sea like a poop deck from which one controls the
squadron  of offshore islands,  while in back, on the right and left, the sea
foams along the flanks of sand and rocks-this  is an indescribable  place.
The  furious  wind  whistles  so  strongly  in  the  columns  that  one  would
believe  oneself to be in a lively forest. It swirls the blue air, sucks up the
fresh sea wind, violently  blends with the fragrance  rising from the hill
covered  in miniscule  fresh flowers, and furiously , without  truce, snaps
woven  blue cloths of air and light around  us. Sat at the foot of the temple
to shelter  ourselves  from the wind; the light immediately  cleared  in a sort
of immobile  gush. The islands  drift in the distance.  Not a single bird. The
sea foams softly all the way to the horizon. Perfect moment.

Perfect,  except  for this island across from Makronisos,2  empty today
it's true, but it was once a deportation  island of which I'm told terrible
tales.
All the way at the bottom,  on the small beach, we have a lunch of fish
and cheese  in front of the large fishing  boats in the small port. Toward the
middle  of the afternoon,  the colors darken,  the islands  solidify , the skies
lighten.  This is the perfect  moment of light, of abandon,  where All is well.
But because  of my lecture,  I must leave. I tear myself  from these places
with sadness and I never leave them completely .
But  on  the  promontory  again,  before  taking  to  the  road,  one  sees
Makronisos.  Throughout  the entire trip back, the most beautiful  light that
I have had here, over the fields of olive trees, fig trees with particularly
green leaves, rare cypresses and eucalypti.
Lecture.  Dinner where  I obtain information  on the deportation.  The
figures  seem to agree. The number  of deportees  was reduced  to 8 or 900.
It is with this that I should be occupied.
30.
National  Museum.  Again I go to see the large and lean Kouros  statues.
Repetition  of Hecuba.  Except  one, these young Greek girls lack grace and
style. Dinner  in Kifissia;  beneath the soft light the garden  resonates  with
the nightingales' song.
Afternoon.  Work, then the Hill of the Muses.  This time the sun is close
to setting. Again a sort of hilarious joy before the  extraordinary  audacity
of  the  Acropolis,  where  the  architects  played  not  with  harmonious
measures  but with the extraord inary extravagance  of the capes,  of the
islands  thrown  on the immense  gulf, and of a vast, swirling,  conch-shell
sky. It is not the Parthenon  that they built but the space itself, and with a
delirious  view. Over this entire squadron  of islands  and peaks, dominated
by the rock's poop deck, the appeasement  of night falls suddenly and [. .

Inserted Letter .
My dear X.
My current  silence  interests  only me. It touches  too many parts of my
personal  life  for  me  to  explain  it  to  you.  Nonetheless,  you  will  be
delighted  to know that if I had spoken  I wouldn't  have said what you hope
for, I wouldn't  have given that pleasure  to anyone.  Besides,  the cause that
interests  you does not lack appointed lawyers  (I recognize,  moreover , that
they have not been very vigorous  in the circumstance).  But your letter
pushes  me to say one thing that I've wanted  to say to you for a long time
now. Namely that in the grand conflict  that cuts the XXth century  in two,
you have already chosen.
For example, you know that East Germany  has been rearmed  for a long
time and that a certain  number  of old Nazi generals  are active there, just
like  in  the  West.  On  several  occasions  the  U.S.S.R.  has  recognized
Germany's  right to have national forces.  You say nothing  of this. It is
because  you accept this rearmament  if it is controlled  by the U.S.S.R.,  but
you  refuse  it  within  a  Western  framework.  And  it  is  like  this  with
everything.  In  extreme  cases  (ask  yourself),  you  would  accept  the
transformation  of France  into a popular  democracy  under the Red Army's
protection  (and I remind  you that I defended-me-the  communists  against
all "atlantization " of domestic  policy). Every time that you spoke or wrote
to  me  of  these  problems,  your  implicit  opinion  was  obvious,  your
indignation  only sincere  in the face of Rosenber g-type  crimes,'  but as
soon as it was about the repression  of a worker's  rebellion  in Germany ,
courtesy  of a communist  regime, this created  a sort of silence  in you,
filled with doubts  (this last point is important  and it seems to me a painful
but decisive test of left-wing intellectuals).
Thus, in my opinion,  you have chosen.  And since you have chosen, it is
normal  that you enter the Communist Party. It is not I who will reproach
you  for  it.  I  don't  have  contem pt  for  communist  activists,  although  I
believe  them to be making  it fatal error. I have an excess  of contempt for
the intellectuals  who are not really intellectuals,  who murder  us with their

pseudo-ripping  of  secular  priests,  and  who,  finally,  give  themselves  a
clear conscience at the expense of the working activists.
Then, once and for all, do what you wish to dostraighten  yourself  out
with  yourself.  You'll  see  then. You  constantly  compare  two  things  of
which you only know and judge one-the  society  in which we live-and  you
ignore  the other. The Communi st Party will not help you know popular
democracy . Far from it. But it will help you know Communism,  of which
you know very little. If you find peace there, a rule of life, this will be all
for  the  better.  If  not,  at  least  you  will  have  found  there  a  true
understanding of the question.
Solely  to  avoid  any  error,  I  repeat  to  you  what  I  believe.  German
rearmament  must be condemned  in both cases, otherwise  everything  is a
deception.  And if I continue  to find helping  Franco  or the "fruit-bearing"
policy in South America  or colonialism  inexcusable,  I do not accept  the
fruitbearing  policy  grafted  on  France  courtesy  of  Russia  and  its
unconditional  supporter:  the  French  Communist  Party.  In  general,  I
remain  fundamentally  opposed  to the initiatives  and methods  of what I've
called Caesarian socialism.
Besides,  these are things that you know. My books have simply  meant
much less to you than you say. Your sympathy  for me was more real. But
the one who enters into religion,  he also loved his friends  and his mother,
and yet he abandons them. For I cannot  let you believe  then that you are
not entering  a church the second  you choose  an orthodoxy  like that of the
Communist  Party. Do not doubt,  but on the contrary , recognize  in your
heart that communist temptation  is, for an intellectual,  of the same nature
as religious  temptation.  There is nothing  shameful  in it, provide d that one
loyally  submits  with full knowledge  of the facts. As for me, you maintain,
even from afar, my friendship.  I only ask that if you take action on your
project,  when you hear that I am, objectively , as one says, a dreadful
fascist,  don't deny it, which will be impossible,  but, try not to think it.
Good  luck,  from  the  bottom  of  my  heart,  and  believe  in  my  faithful
thoughts.

these dances  interesting  but the dancers,  particularly  the female  dancers,
are too unattractive.
May 1.
Early  morning  departure  for Argolid. The  Corinthian  Gulf  coast. A
shimmering  light, ethereal  and jubilant,  inun dates the gulf and offshore
islands.  Stopped  a  moment  at  the  edge  of  the  cliff,  the  sea's  entire
immensity  ahead of us, offered in a single bend, like a caesura  where we
drink the light and air , in long gulps.
After an hour on the road I am literally  drunk with light, head full of
flashes  and  silent  cries;  within  the  heart's  den,  an  enormous  joy,  an
interminable  laughter ,  that  of  knowledge,  after  which  anything  can
happen  and everything  is accepted. Descent  on Mycenae  and Argos. The
Mycenaean  fortress  is  covered  with  thick  bunches  of  poppies,  which
tremble  beneath  the wind above the royal tombs.  (Every  part of Greece  I
have  traveled  through  is  at  this  moment  covered  with  poppies  and
thousands  of flowers.)  Above  the fortress,  the plain stretches  up to Argos
and the sea. Agamemnon's  kingdom  is no bigger than ten kilometers and
yet the proportions  are such that never has a more immense  kingdom
extended  under the sun. Mycenae-sunk  between  its two high boulders,
surrounded  by enormous  blocks,  beneath  a light that become s frightful
here-is today the savage queen of this unfor gettable land.
The  ruins  of  Argos  are  without  much  interest  for  me.  The  young
archaeologist,  Georges Roux, Vauclusian,  so alive, so impassioned  by his
beautiful  trade, he interests  me quite a bit. I envy him a little and bitterly
reproach  myself  for  the  wasted  time  of  these  last  years  and  for  my
profound  failure. We lunch in Asini, and before  the lunch I swim in a
crystalline and cold water on the beautiful beach.
In  the  afternoon,  in  Epidaurus,  the  May  1st  festival  has  brought  a
kermis  of joyous  Greeks.  But from above the theatre,  in a thick and tepid

light that spills over the slopes of olive trees, eucalypti,  [... ]'~  and acacias,
every sound resonates  in a sort of vast and gentle disaffection. Only the
weak bells of sheep herds make themselves  heard above the other sounds,
but always with the same disaf fection. Here, the hour is still perfect.
Soiree.  Nafplion  before the sea, at this hour, which the Greeks  call the
royalty  of the sun and which is the hour of crimson  in the sky, of mauves
and blues deposited on the mountains and bays.
May 2.
Depart  for Sparta in the morning beneath  a formidable  sky. Each wide
valley constitute s a kingdom  of olive trees and majestic  cypresses, and
mountains,  every so often a village-Greece  is deserted  here-only  the pink,
green, and red painted herds of sheep travel it. Over the plain of Evro- tas,
Sparta,  beneath  the snowy  Taygetus, stretches  its fields of orange trees,
their abundant perfume  no longer  leaving  us. Over the ruins of Mystras,
flights  of  turtledoves.  A  tranquil  monastery  with  whitewashed  walls,
opened  over  the  immense  plain  of  Laconia  to  the  well-rou nded  and
wellseparated olive trees, shivering beneath a tireless sun.
Upon returning,  the descent  on Nafplion,  its gulf, the islands  and the
mountains,  in the distance.  Stop in Argos with the young archaeologists
doing the excavations.  Same impression  as in front of the small group of
architects  who rebuild  Orleansv ille and live there in a community . I have
only been happy and at peace in a trade, a job accomplished  with other
men whom I can like. I do not have a trade, but only a vocation.  And my
work is solitary . I must accept it and try only to be worthy  of it, which is
not the case at this moment.  But I cannot  protect  myself  from a feeling  of
melancholy  in the presence  of these men who are happy with what they
do.
We return to Mycenae; the sun has just gone down at the moment  we
reach the highest  terrace.  Between  the steep peaks which dominate  it, a
transparent  moon  softly  sails.  But  across  from  us,  the  darkened  plain

extends  from the foot of the Blue Mountains  of Argos all the way to the
brighter  sea on our right. The space is immense,  the silence  so absolute
that the foot regrets  having  caused a stone to roll. A train chuffs in the
distance,  on the plain a donkey  brays and the sound rises up to us, the
herds' bells rush down the slopes like a whisper  of water. On this wild and
tender  setting  [...1-  is magnificent.  Over the now blooming  poppies,  a
light wind passes very close to the ground.  The most beautiful  evening  in
the world sets little by little over the Mycenaean  lions. The mountains
darken  little by little until the ten chains,  which are reflected  all the way to
the horizon,  become  a single blue vapor. It was worth the grief of coming
from so far to receive  this grand bit of eternity . After this, the rest is no
longer important.
May .3.
Work in the morning.  Depart  for Delphi  at one P.m. Always  the same
light but this time over less considerable  heights,  stony, without  a tree. It's
at this point that one realizes  Greece  is primarily  a space made of curved
or straight lines, but always  sharply contoured.  The entire earth outlines
the sky and gives it its form, but the sky in turn would be nothing without
these reliefs whose  harmonious  closure  organizes  its own space. This is
why  every  mile  has  divided  this  place  into  the  grand  kingdoms:  the
surface  of the earth is double  that of the sky. Arrive  in a sort of basin, a
single cloud that we watched  swell for some time now bursts and blusters
in only seconds . Solid hailstones  pound the car with a deafening  sound.
Five minutes  later, out of the basin, we once again find the sky clear and
carry on cheerfully .
Delphi.  Initially , most striking  about the grandeur  of the site is, at the
bottom  of the immense  valley, this murky  green river which pushes  its
muscular  hindquarters [...]8  toward  the sea. The olive trees are packed  so
tightly  one against  the other that seeing them from this height,  they make
only one quivering path toward  the horizon.  As for the ruins, the storm,
which has also fallen on Delphi,  has wet them. They appear  more alive in
the middle of the more vivacious  flowers  and greener  grasses. A black

eagle sails very high for a few seconds  and disappears.  Then the day
lightens  and from the high cliffs a tranquility  that announces  the night
begins to fall. Return to the stadium from which I leave happy .
Evening.  In a bouzoukia,`'  four Greeks  kindly invite me to dance.  But
their steps are too difficult. If I had the time for it, I would like to learn.
From my room, the valley fills with shadows  all the way to the small
strand  of  lights  that  border  the  sea.  Surrounded  by  filmy  scarves,  the
moon  places  a  fine,  powdery   light  over  the  mountains  and  shaded
hollows.  The silence, vast as space, is good.
May 4.
Depart  in the morning  for Volos. Rough  mountains,  then the plain of
Lamia.  More mountains,  softer, greener  beneath  the rising sun-and  this is
the  immense  plain  of  Thessaly .  The  Vlachs'  primitive  huts-and  the
immense  expanse.  The East is not far. Volos. 80% of the houses  have been
destroyed  or knocked  down. The entire city is under tents. The sun weighs
on the cloths and the dusty city. Few or no bathrooms.  I wonder  how they
avoid epidemics.  French  lycee under the tents. And the sea quite close,
slick and cool, at the edge of the ruined city. The mayor receives  me in the
courtyard  near the ruined house.  Intelligent  and elegant  character . Due to
an offhand remark,  a hairdresser  arrives  and cuts my hair in the courtyard,
in front of everyone, with the most charming  familiarity . Still in the city.
The Mass celebrated  outside,  the hospital  tent, etc. Return  to Larissa  by
car. Railcar. Larissa to Salonica.  During  the night we travel parallel  to the
sea glistening beneath the moon.  Arrival 1 1:00 tttit.
May 5.
Work.  Lunch  with  Turner  and  Colonel  Bramble'  (or  someone  who
strongly  resembles him). Byzantine  churches.  The small convent  with the
peacocks.  St. David,  St. Georges. St. Dimitriu.  The twelve  apostles  (St.
Sophie  of no interest).  I am not, very touched  by Byzantine  artone must
acknowledge  it, though-but  interested in this evolution  that goes from the

Vth to the XIIth century  and which makes it possible  to reconsti tute a link
between  the Hellenistic  period  and the Quattrocento.  For example, the
mosaics  and frescos  of the twelve  apostles  are far from the stiffness and
hieraticism  of that art's first centuries.  There one finds the beginnings  of
Duccio.  A little later (in the evening) I question  a specialist  who teaches
me  that  the  Byzantine  artists  emigrated  to  Italy  after  the  fall  of
Constantinople.
Little by little, the Eastern influence will be eliminated in this way .
Evening.  Lecture.  Am touched  by a registered  girl.2  Reception  for the
University  students. During  the night I rest on my room's  balcony, to gaze
at the port, the caiques,  the sea's flowery  quay, and to breathe  the beautiful
scent of salt and the night.
May 6, 7, 8.
Lunch  with T. in front of the sea, atop a cliff. The hour is pleasant.
Afterward,  T. plays me the latest compositions.  I must leave. Plane. The
Sporades  drift off below us in the glittering  sea. Dinner  Merlier .33 At
midnight  D. comes to get me and we leave for Piraeus  where M. Algades
and  his  attractive  cutter  await  us.  Good-natured  man,  delighted  and
cordial.  We leave Piraeus  under an ashen moon that illuminat es the sea
with a hot, irreal light. I am happy to feel the water hitting  the hull and to
see again a light foam slipping  by both sides of the ship's stem. But after a
moment  we see the fog literally  being born from the sea, layer upon layer,
thickening  and, little by little, blocking  the horizon.  It is cold and damp.
Algades  claims  that he has never seen this in the archipelago.  He has to
reroute  the cutter to avoid two small islands.  I go down to lie down.
Impossible  to sleep until six A.M. Two hours later I awaken  and go back
up on the deck. The fog is still there. Algades  and his mariner  kept watch
all night out of fear of running  aground.  But little by little the sun rises,
shows itself, pale, breaks  through the fog and finally  dispels  it. Around
eleven  o'clock we move (without  sails because  there is no wind) on a
motionless  sea in a glittering  and delicate  light. The air is so limpid  it

seems that the least noise could be heard from the far end of the horizon.
The sun warms  the deck and its heat rises little by little. Then the first
island appears.  We pass between Se- riphos  and Sifnos,  because  of the
detour we made. On the horizon , Syros and the other islands  take shape,
all appearing  like a sketch in the sky. On the inverted  hull of the islands,
the small villages  fixed upon the slopes look like shells, pallid concretions
left by the receded sea.
The small yellow islands like bundles of wheat on the blue sea.
We sail in the middle  of these distant  islands  on an illuminated  sea,
which  gently  wrinkles  itself,  runs  parallel  to  Syros  at  length;  soon
Mykonos  appears and as the day advances  it begins  to become  clearer, its
snakehead  that bends toward  Delos still invisible  behind  Rinia. The sun
sets as we find ourselves  nearly in the center of a circle of islands  whose
colors begin to change.  Faded gold, cyclamen,  a mauve-green,  then the
colors darken and on the still glistening  sea the island masses  become  a
dark blue. It is a strange  and vast calming  that then falls on the waters.
Happiness  at last, happiness  close to tears, because  I wish to hold against
me,  to  squeeze ,  this  inexpressible  joy  that,  however ,  I  know  must
disappear . But for so many days it lasts faintly, today it grips my heart so
definitely  that it seems to me I should  be able to regain it faithfully every
time I wish to do so.
Night has fallen when we descend  on Mykonos.  As many churches  as
houses.  All white. We wander  in the small streets where colored  boutiques
open. In the pitch-black  streets we come across the scent of honeysuckle.
The moon shines faintly  above the white terraces.  We climb back aboard
and I lie down so happy that I don't even feel my fatigue.
In the morning  a divine light falls on the bleached  houses  of Mykonos.
We raise the anchor  for Delos.  The sea is beautiful,  crystalline  and pure
above the sea bed of which we already  catch sight. While approaching
Delos, we glimpse enormous  bunches  of poppies  on the first slopes of the
island.

Delos. The island of lions and bulls, representations  of which cover this
island of animals,  but one must add snakes  to it [...]4  and large lizards
with dark bodies, but light green at the tail and head, and the dolphins  of
the mosaics.  The marble  that the lions are made of is eroded  and pitted by
the effects of the erosion,  so much so that they appear  to be made of rock
salt, a little ghostly, they give one the impression  that the first rains will
dissolve  them. But this island of lions and bulls is also covered  with the
brown  and  friable  bones  that  are  the  ruins,  and  beneath  these  bones,
suddenly , admirable and fresh discoveries (mosaics of Dionysus at rest).
The island of ruins and flowers  (poppies,  convolvulus,  wallflowers,
asters)  also. The island of the mutilated  gods of the museum  (little kore
statues).  At noon, climbed  to the top of Cynthe,  and the surround ing gulfs,
the light, the reds and the whites; the entire circle of the Cyclades  turns
slowly  around Delos, on the sparkling  sea, in one movement,  a sort of
motionless  dance. This world of islands  so narrow  and so vast appears  to
me to be the heart of the world.  And at the center of this heart stands
Delos  and  this  peak  where  I  am,  from  where  I  can  look  beneath  the
straight  and pure light of the world,  at the perfect  circle that borders my
kingdom.
Returned  later by rowboat,  a ravishing Greek teenager , dressed  simply
on the quay. When the rowboat  leaves  the quay I wave to her and she
immediately  responds with a beautiful  smile. On the cutter I undress  and
plunge  into the transparent  green water. It is ice cold, and I climb back up
after some strokes.  We return to Mykonos.  Feeling  of infinite  freedom  to
travel the sea like this, in all directions,  from one island to the next. And a
freedom  not  at  all  limited  by  the  fact  that  this  world  of  islands  has
boundaries.  On the contrary , this freedom  exults in its circle.  For me,
freedom  would not be to puncture  this circle and sail toward  Sumatra, but
to go farther  from this bare island to an island of trees, and from the rock
to an island of flowers.
In Mykonos  to shop. I preferred  the city at night. We return to sea late.
Strange  sadness  so similar  to the sadness  of love while watching  Delos
and Cynthe  disappear  little by little behind  Rinia. For the first time I

watch a land that I love disappe aring with the painful  feeling  that perhaps
I will never see it again before (lying. Heartache.  The colors again change
over the sea and islands  [...]5  the sails, which flap softly with a light wind.
Hardly  have we tasted the peace that rises from the sea toward  the sky,
that, empties its light little by little, and already  behind  a rocky isle the
moon rises. It rises rapidly  in the sky, then illuminates  the waters. Until
midnight,  I gaze at it, I listen to the sails, I inwardly  accompany  the
movement  of the water on the sides of the ship. Free life of the sea and the
happiness  of these days. All is forgotten  here and all is remade. These
marvelous  days spent flying on the water, between  islands  covered  with
corollas  and columns,  in a tireless  light; I retain the taste of it in my
mouth, in my heart, a second revelation, a second birth....
In the morning,  head wind, the sails whip, the heel increases  and we
head for Piraeus  with the loud noise of water and fabric.  Rain of light,
drops of which fall and bounce  back on the morning  sea. Despaired  to
leave this archipelago, but this despair itself is good.
May 9.
Depart  for Olympia.  The road to the Gulf of Corinth.  Beaches  and
gulfs. Swim in Xylokastro.  This time it is the intensity  of the trees, the
waters,  the fresh fruits of the earth. A little before  Olympia,  the hills are
covered  with fragile  cypresses.  Gentleness  and tenderness  of these places
beneath  a light that is, for the first time, a little grey. The tall pines and the
remains  of the temples to Zeus and Hera. The birds' cries, the day ending,
the peace that soon rises from the dormant glen.  At night I think of Delos.
May 10.
For the first time, the morning  is grey on the Alpheus  valley, which I
see from my window. But a soft light falls on the stones,  cypresses,  and
green prairies. Since Delos,  I could feel nothing  more than the peace of
these hills, this soft shade, this silence  nourished  by the birds' soft cries.
Museum.  Along  with  the  frescoes  of  Sifnos  in  Delphi,  the  height  of

classical  sculpture.  Next to Apollo  or the three male figures  of the East
Pediment,  or the different Athenas from the metopes,  Praxitele's  Hermes
is a sugary success  that stinks of decadence.  Behind  it, moreover, two
superb,  large-framed  terra  cottas  representing  a  warrior  and  Zeus
removing  Ganymede  are  evidence  of  a  superbly  different  art.  Strange
archaic  bronze  kore statues,  griffins, figurines  that seem to come straight
from the East. Stroll. It. rains lightly, and the tender and washed  colors of
the valley are gentle on the eye. Fascinated  by the diversity  of landscapes.
In fact, everything  that Greece attempts  with landscapes,  it succeeds  at
and leads to perfection.
In the company  of the villager s and their gentle familiarity . Free in
appearance  and movement  even though  political  freedom  does not exist
here.
Brief evening rain. I climb up on the hill through  batches  of aromatic
flowers.  Small village  of Thronia. Miserable  houses.  Children  in tattered
rags although apparently in good health.
May 12.
Cool and bright morning.  The shade beneath  the trees surrounding  the
ruins  is  quite  precious.  The  light.  is  divine.  Swim  and  lunch  in
Xylokastro.  The clear water is not as cold but the air has become  mostly
transparent  and all the mountain s on the other side of the Gulf of Corinth
are  revealed  with  a  strange  purity.  M.  has  a  sumptuous  smile  in  this
landscape.  And like this, the whole route, soon the gulf of Athens,  the
islands,  from which we can make out each house and each tree. I cease
noting  here these pleasures  which from now on overwhelm  me. Chaste
pleasures, sober , strong, like joy itself, and the air that we breathe.
Thisssion.
In the luminous and clear sky the moon's tip like a hawthorn petal.

Evening  at R.D. The honeysuc kles, the bay far off in the night., the
mysterious taste of life.
May 13.
These twenty  days of racing through Greece,  I contemplate  them now
from Athens, before my departure,  and they seem to me like a lone and
lengthy  source  of light that I will be able to keep at the center of my life.
For  me,  Greece  is  no  more  than  a  long  glittering  day  extended  over
voyages,  and also like an enormous island covered  with red flowers and
mutilated  gods endlessly  afloat on a sea of light, beneath  a crystalline sky.
To retain this light, to return,  to no longer give in to the darkness  of days
...
May 14.
Depart  for Aegina.  Calm sea. Hot and blue sky. Small port. Caiques.
Aphaia's  ascension.  The  three  temples  that  suspend  a  blue  triangle  in
space:  Parthenon,  Sounion,  Aphaia.  I sleep on the temple's  flagstones,
beneath  the columns'  shade. Prolonged  dip in a small, tepid cove in Aya
Marina.  On  the  port  in  the  evening  they  sell  large  lilies  whose  scent
suffocates.  Aegina  is  the  island  of  lilies.  Return.  The  sun  goes  down,
disappears  in the clouds,  transforms  itself into a golden  fan and then into a
big wheel with blinding  rays. The islands,  which  I permanently  leave
tonight, again drift away . Stupid desire to cry .
The Variguerez evening and the shadow puppets.
May 15.
Sunday .  Byzantine  museum.  With  the  D.'s  in  Kifissia,  then  on  the
beaches  of Athens.  Stroll by the sea beneath  a nice wind full of light. For
me these are the last hours, the farewell  to this country , which for weeks
has poured the same long joy over us.

May 16.
Depart for Paris, heart aching.

Novel.  Do  not  forget  Italy  and  the  discovery  of  art-and  of  religion
suddenly revealed in its relationship with art.
Each  time  this  peaceful  heart.  And  yet  this  time,  continuously
exhausted,  incapable  of coolness  or emotion.  And yet San Leo'  and the
heart open on a beneficial  silence.  Dear Italy where I will be cured of
everything.  On the way hack, the old smell of dusty pathways.  White
oxen with long Romagna  horns drag squeaking  carts. The scent of sun and
straw.
San Leo-and  this desire of mine to retire there-Make  a list of places
where  I  think  that  I  could  live  and  die. Always  small  cities.  Tipasa.
Djemila.  Cabris. Valdemosa.  Cabrieres  d'Avignon  etc., etc. Return  to San
Leo.
Urbino.  These  small,  well-enclosed  cities,  austere,  quiet,  closed  up
around  their  perfection.  At  the  heart  of  the  heavy  fortifications,  the
indifferent  characters  of  della  Francesca's  "Flagellation"  wait  eternally
before  the  angels  and  the  haughty  Madonna.  Sansepolcro.:l  Christ  is
resurrected.  And here he is rising from the tomb, savage  militant.  Piero

at the end of a life.  Vast, even, beneath the calm sky , it keeps the secret.
I rediscover the sea, again, tepid and gentle on the muscles.
The weight of St Croix. Madonna del Parto4
At the end of my life I would like to return to the path that runs down
the Sansepolcro  valley, descend  slowly, stroll in the valley between  the
wispy olive trees and the long cypresses,  and in a house with thick walls
and cool rooms find a bare room with narrow  windows  from where I can
watch night descend  upon the valley. I would like to return to the Prato
garden  in Arezzo one evening  and again walk the guard path atop the
fortress,  watch night settling  on this incomparable  earth. I would like . . .

Everywhere  and  always  this  desire  for  solitude,  which  I  don't  even
understand  and which is like an announcement  of a sort of death tinged
with the taste of the contemplation that accompanies it.
Rediscovering  Piazza della Signoria  in Gubbio  and gazing  for a long
time at the rain falling  over the valley. Seeing  Assisi without  tourists  or
Vespas and listening to the harmony of the stars on S. Francesco's  upper
square.  Seeing  Perugia  without  the houses  which are built all around,  and
thus, one cool morning,  able to gaze at the hills' wispy olive trees over the
borders of Porta del Sole.
But especially, especially , repeat on foot, with a backpack,  the route
from Monte  San Savino  to Siena,  to walk alongside  this field of olive
trees and grapes,  whose  scent I smell, by these hills of bluish tuff that
extend  all the way to the horizon,  to then see Siena spring up in the setting
sun with its minarets, like a perfect Constantinople,  to arrive there during
the night, alone and without  money, to sleep near a fountain  and be the
first on the palm-shaped  Campo,  like a hand that offers the greatest  of
what man has made, after Greece.
Yes, I would  like to revisit Arezzo's  sloping  square,  the shell of the
Campo  in Siena, and again eat from the heart of watermelons  on the hot
streets of  Verona.
When I am old I would like to be given the chance  to return to this road
in Siena, which is equaled  by nothing else in the world, and to die there in
a ditch, surrounded  only by the kindness  of these unknown  Italians whom
I love.

Algiers. January 18.1i
This  anguish  that  I  dragged  through  Paris,  and  which  concerned
Algeria,  has left me. Here at least one is in the struggle,  difficult for those
of us who have put public  opinion against  us. But it is in the struggle,

finally, that I've always  found my peace. The intellectual,  by function,  and
no matter what, he has some, and especially  if he meddles  in public affairs
only by writing  about them, lives like a coward.  He compensates  for this
impotence  with verbal exaggeration.  Only risk justifies  thought.  And then
anything  is better than this France  of resignation  and brutality , this swamp
where I suffocate. Yes, I arose happy, for the first time in months.  I've
recovered the star .
My entire life, through  everything  that France  has endlessly  made of
me, I've tried to connect  with what Spain left in my blood, and what, in
my opinion, was the truth.

St Augustine8  lived in the totalitarian  world:  the late Roman  Empire.

XVIIth century , Augustinian century .
Novel.  Portrait  of V.U. She has big strong hands and, at the end of a
thin elegant  body, the feet of a dancer. Everything  is action,  unrestrained
ferocity in the dance where she reveals herself completely .
She celebrates the anniversary  of the day she got her car, puts the dress
that she just bought  at the foot of her bed every evening  so that she can
have the joy of seeing it when she awakens.
She does not express  herself  except  in indefinite  terms. She has to go
pick someone up someplace  so that she can go to another  place where she
has to do something ... etc. Double or triple hidden  lives (cf. X. "I have a
lunch").  "I have impure  thoughts," she says. And, about someone who
does not truly inspire impure thoughts: "It's in the bag."
The men with whom she has had relationships,  they appear  to her to be
of another  race. "Like Zulus,"  she says. "How not to feel compassion
before an intelligent man. Everything  that he knows and sees others put up
with because they don't know or see it." "Women expect  from men all the
happiness  of their life." "Women who don't please are stingy with the only
man whom they have. Only women who please are capable  of generosity ."
"I don't love really young  people,  they're  idiots. A man always  believes
himself  superior  to the woman  whom he ... I accept this sentiment  from an
intelligent  man, not. from a young imbecile."  Her small car. "I cannot  do
with out it; I love it with tenderness for all the freedom  that it gives me."
There  she  keeps  the  old  and  filthy  slippers  that  she  wears  to  drive,
abandoning  her elegant  Louis XV heels. For that matter, she abandons  her
shoes everywher e, cinemas,  restaurants,  etc. Lovely  feet of the dancer that
she  is.  "In  my  neighborhood  there  are  only  grandmas  and  pellagra
sufferers so people notice me."
She arrives at the hotel with her baskets  full of makeup  and toiletries,
her long thin blond hair [...].'
"Let's be frank, fame is an aphrodisiac."

If she became  a billionaire,  more exactly, if she married  Onassis,  she
would macerate  in a gold or platinum  bathtubwhich  would better match

"I love my car more than my mother ." She loves her era.
Her avidity  to laugh. Her determination  to seize everything,  succeed  in
everything,  to  taste  all  of  today's  pleasures:  ski,  sea,  dance,  high  life,
commercial  success.  And clear in this frenzied  desire.  Because  of him. "I
have  defense."  Her  words:  "She  spilled  an  omelet  onto  her  head"
(speaking  about a blond);  "she would wreak havoc in a herd of Jesuits";
"during  her shtick she can do a handstand  or skin the cat, either way she is
applauded."  Since I have a bandage  on my finger, having  cut myself:  "that
makes you look like a clumsy carpenter ."
What I love about V., what makes her attractive:  she sticks to her class,
however  unbearable, which is to say that she has figured  out what she can
give without complication  (develop). V. and marriage.  She will be faithful
if she marries. She will owe that much to the poor guy who ... etc.
One always sees her fresh young lady's petticoat  when she sits down. "I
don't understand  these married  women  who harass their husbands.  They
have money, a father for their children,  security , their old days insured,
and they ask for fidelity  in addition.  They overdo  it." And further:  "In
marriage  the man has everythin g to lose, the woman  everything  to gain,"
etc., etc.

July. Palermo.5

Three days of mistral  had brushed,  polished  the sky to its most delicate
base, a thin layer, transparent  and blue, swollen  with a heavy weight  of
gilded water ... and as such, we waited  for it to burst and for a wave of Vin
Jaune to drown the earth beneath an exultant flood.
July 12. Palermo.
About the mistral.  The days are hot and I wait for the mistral  to pick up.
Then I went on the hill that was covered  in aromatic  herbs and minuscule
snail fossils. The mistral  descended  from the north, sweeping  the nearby
mountains,  brushing  the sky to its base, mashing  and cleaning  the trees,
howling  in the countryside,  keeping  animals  and people  in the houses,
prevailing  at  last....  Etc. And  lying  on  the  hill,  crushing  shells,  in  the
violent bath of wind and sun ... the celebration.
A.B. writes to me about Van Eyck's true history. Shortly  after the theft,
a  priest  attached  to  the  chapter  was  suspected.  He  confessed.  He  had
stolen  the  panel  because  he  could  not  stand  to  see  judges  near  the
Adoration  of the Mystic  Lamb. Considering  his intentions,  he receives
absolution  by promising  to reveal the panel's  hiding  place the day of his
death. The day comes.  Extreme  Unction.  He wants to speak, but his voice
fades away . He utters unintelligible words and dies.6
Through  the  years,  what  I  have  always  found  at  the  heart  of  my
sensibility  is the refusal  to disappear  from this world,  from its joys, its
pleasures, its suf ferings, and this refusal has made an artist of me.

Tolstoy:  "Political  literature,  reflecting  the  transitory  interests  of
society,  has  its  importance,  yet,  however  necessary  to  the  people's
development,  there still exists another  literature  that, echoes  the eternal
preoccupations  shared  by  all  mankind,  and  which  contains  creations
precious  to the heart of the people,  a literature  accessible  to the man of
any class, of any time, and without  which no vigorous  population  full of
strength has ever developed."

C.9  I love this anxious, wounded  little face, tragic at times, beautiful
always;  this little being with attachments  so strong but with a face lit by a

Novel.  After loving  Jessica  for fifteen  years, he meets a young dancer
who has, with slight differences,  the same talents,  the same fire as J. And
something  is born in Jean that resembles  the love that he had for J. As if
he  were  still  capable  of  beginning  again  (and  as  M.H.,  in  the  same
position,  had loved Jessica  without  saying so). But he is old, she is young,
he still loves Jessica  and the love that he had for her. He is silent. Gives
up. Life does not begin again. Hardly  had he discovered,  or believed  to
discover , that he loved her when, terrified,  he decided  never to lay his
hands on her. He would like it if those whom we begin to love could know
us as we were before meeting  them so that they could perceive  what they
have made of us.
Inserted letter .
I am old or I will be. I've spent half of my life as a man defending one
person  at the price of sacrificing  another  and perhaps  a part of myself.
What I've spent twelve  years protecting,  I cannot  throw away for a few
months  or  a  few  years  of  life. The  person  for  whom  I  broke  another
person,  I cannot  break her in turn, like a mischievous  child who mutilates
all his toys one after the other .
I've  always  thought  that  love,  that  any  feeling,  always  ended  up
resembling  what it was at the very second  of its conception.  And what I've
felt before  you is love without  possession,  the heart's  gift. Possession  is
added to love and it has a dimension but not sensual....
It's there that perhaps we could rediscover  a sort of alliance,  a marriage
known only to us, an engagement, an agreement.
Time no longer existed  for me; 10 hours a day in the theatre  basement
beneath  the rehearsal  lamps'  poor, and at the same time intense,  light;
fascinated,  I followed  over this small face which was lit from inside by
another  light, a day of suffering, all the emotions  that the pain of living
can produce  on the human  face. I was there, before what is most profound,

wounded,  solemn,  and  unarme d  in  man. And  when  we  went  out,  the
unpredictable  rains or the gentle September  nights were welcomed  as they
were, an immutable  order, the backdrop  for that which is agitated and
suffered  in  the  hearts  of  men  and  women,  and  which,  alone  for  long
weeks, made me alive and full.

Alone in the car after a long night's  work, Paris deserted,  and the long
rain resounding  over the steel plates above them. On this face lit only by
the gleam of a streetlight  through the windshield,  the shadows  of water
droplets  streame d on the glass, ran without  end. Around  this shadow  they
huddled  in their sheet-metal  house,  and around  them the street, the silent
city, a continent , the world in flames,  and he could not tire of looking  at
this face streaming with shadowy tears.
"Our  gentle,  secret,  solitary  vacations."  He  shook  the  tree  branches
above the walls, and water droplets rained down over his friend's  surprised
face. One by one he drank these droplets  that shone like feverish  and
tender eyes.

he has spirit and sensual  pleasure  and he enjoys  the charms  and intrigues
of  knowledgew hich  he  pursues  up  to  the  highest  and  most  remote
starsuntil  finally there is no knowledge  left for him to chase, except that
which  is  absolutely  painful,  like  the  drunkard  who  ends  up  drinking
absinthe  and aqua fortis. This is why he ends up wanting  hell. It is the last
knowledge  that  seduces  him.  Perhaps  it  will  also  disappoint  him,  like
everything  he knows.  Then he would  have to come to a stop for all of
eternity ,  nailed  to  disillusion,  and  he  himself  would  become  the  stone
guest, desiring  an evening  meal of knowledge,  a meal that he will never
have. For the whole world of creatures  finds not a bite to give to this
hungry mouth.

Joanna  the  Mad;;  remained  forty-four  years  in  a  small,  windowless
room-lit  day and night by a lamp-from  which she left only to go to the
neighboring  convent  and to gaze at her husband's  grave. Perhaps  this is
real life.

The Canadian  prostitute  in a cafe near the Folies-  Bergere: "My father

Play. A writer (or savant  or artist or actor) overworked  due to social

In the world there is, parallel  to the force of death and constraint,  an
enormous force of persuasion that is called culture.
In the Old Testament  God says nothing,  it is the living people who

N.  realized.  Multiplication  of  experiences  but  controlled,  oriented
toward  the greatest  being and the highest  epoch,  by extreme  freedom  but
according  to discipline-and  the life risked without  truce, like a permanent
sanction-an  accepted and prodigal  solitude,  bowing  only before the human
being, secretly. Say no more but do make meaning  of a higher  word and
speak only according  to ... (For the one who is losing his memory  the
journal  is  like  an  instrumen t  of  that  asceticism.)  Custine:  "Arab
architecture  is  the  art  of  effeminate  people  (cut  out  papers  that

Around  Cordes,  over the perfect circle of hills, the sky rests, tender, airy,
and at the same time both cloudy  and bright.  At night, Venus, big as a
peach,  sets upon the Western hill with tremendous  speed.  It stops for a
moment  on the crest, then abruptly disappears,  sucked  up like a token in a
slot. Soon the stars multiply and the Milky  Way becomes creamy .

It  rains. This  morning,  the  wild Aveyron  Valley. Work.  I  no  longer

Beautiful  and deserted  countryside  where each house encountered  has
fallen apart. In barns gutted and infested  by nettles,  old harrow's  wheels
rust; old and enormous  spiders  haunt this deserted  kingdom.  Rush toward
the cities, the factories,  the collective  pleasures.  Here a civilization  dies
slowly, around us, and the old houses  testify to it. I tell M. who tells me
that she does not have the impression of death but of waiting.  Waiting for
what? - the Messiah.
It is still raining; I am hungry  for light as for bread and can no longer

Thoughts of death.
August 6.
Visiting  Cayla:  a  silent  and  solitary  place  around  which  the  world
comes to die. I understand  better what I later read in Eugenie  de Guerin's
journal:  "I would gladly make a vow of confinement  to Cayla.  No other
place in the world pleases  me like my home."  And yet: "Where  will I be?
Where  will we be when these trees grow tall again?  Others  will stroll
beneath  their shade and will see, as we see, the passing  winds that will
knock them down."
The Old Believers  in Russia  thought that we carry a small devil on the
left shoulder  and an angel on the right shoulder . There is an idea for the
theatre  (for  Don  Faust?):  the  angel  and  the  devil  grow  according  to

whether  they are nourished.  In general,  one or the other is heightened. My
character  returns  with  two  smaller  characters  of  equal  height.  Their
dialogues:  between  them, the character  to the two creatures,  the two to the
character , etc., etc.
"The lightest  silk thread is more unbearable  to me than a lead ball is to

Svidrigailov  from Crime  and Punishment:  "A small room filled with
smoke, with spiders in the corners, and that is all eternity is."'
August 8, 1957. Cordes.
For the first time, after reading  Crime and Punishment,  absolute  doubt
about my vocation. I seriously  consider  the possibility  of giving up. I have
always  believed  that creation  was a dialogue.  But with whom?  Our literary
society  whose principle  is second-rate spite, where offense takes the place
of critical  method?  Society  in general? A populace  that does not read us, a
bourgeoisie  mass, who, in a year, reads the press and two popular  books?
In reality, the creator today can only be a solitary  prophet,  inhabited, eaten
by  a  disproportionate  creation.  Am  I  this  creator?  I  believed  it.  More
precisely , I believed  that I could be it. Today I doubt it, and the temptation
is  strong  to  reject  this  incessant  effort  which  renders  me  unhappy  in
happiness  itself,  this  empty  asceticism,  this  call  that  alerts  me  toward
what, I do not know. I would do theatre,  I would randomly  write dramatic
works,  without worry, I would be free, perhaps.  What do I have to do with
estimable  or honest  art? And am I capable  of what I dream?  If I am not
capable  of it, what good is it to dream?  To free me from this, too, and to
consent to nothing! Others who were greater than I have done it.

To refuse to shine when one can shine, to appeal,  etc. A little artifice is
necessary , but artifice  ends up eating everything.  Moping  (as long as is
necessary)  is ultimately  more fruitful  than chitchatting  and going out for

Novel.  Mi: in love she breathed  like a swimmer  and smiled  at the same

Nietzsche.  "Still a few thousand  years on last century's  track! - And in

precisely  this way the intelligence  will have lost all its dignity. It will be,
without  a doubt,  necessary  to be intelligent,  but it will also be such an
ordinary  thing  that  a  nobler  mind  will  perceive  this  necessity  as  a
vulgarity . Perhaps to be noble will then mean to be mad in the head."

G.T.7  visits before departing for Algeria  to confide  in me what she has
done. One month  ago in Algiers.  Contacted  by  emissaries  of the F.L.N.'
who propose to her a meeting  with those in charge, who have questions  to
ask her regarding  her booklet  (Algeria  '57), she accepts.  Then meeting
procedures:  she  waits  briefly  at  a  house  in  the  Casbah  where  she  is
received  by two women.  Then two armed men arrive.  They argue. G.T.
explains  her thesis to them, the reduction  of a population  to beggary , the
bulk of auxiliar y wages,  which come from France,  the metropolis,  etc.
(her  opinion:  politically  valid,  economically  uncultivated) .  At  this
moment,  the one who appears  to be the leader  says: "You take us for
murderers."  Then G.T. says: "But you are murderers"  (this is shortly  after
the attack on the Casino  de la corniche).  Then the other's  painful  reaction:
tears in his eyes. Then: "These  bombs,  I would  like to see them at the
bottom  of the sea." "That is up to you alone,"  G.T. says. They talk about
torture.  I am the plaintiff, she says (she belonged  to the commission on
[the] network of camps).  They reach [one] compromise:  suppression  of
civilian  terrorism  in exchange  for suppression  of executions.  Pretty much
in the terms that I had propose d (but the follow  up, alas ... ). The other
man regarding  nailings:  "It's France." "Go tell that to your grandmother ,"
G.T.  says,  "I  was  there.  It's  the  F.L.N.  and  you  know  it."  The  leader
motions  to the other man in order to keep him silent. She learns shortly
after that this is Ali la Pointe.  While leaving  she takes him by the tie and
shakes  him.  "And  don't  forget  what  I  said."  And  he  responds:  "No,
M'dame."
2nd meeting after execution  and she learns then that the leader is Yassef

Also shows me the writings  of 30 Arab students  between  the ages of 11

Sperber . The Achilles  Heel, p. 202: "The idea of substituting  a radical
break for suicide  is not new. The will to definitively  disavow  his own acts,
to forever untangle himself  from them, is often found in the dreams that
men devote themselves to: that only the body's  logic still connects  to life
and that nothing  connects  to beings,  neither  what they received  from them
nor even what they gave to them. This dream is born of a solitude capable
of  destroying  everything,  even  the  affection  that  a  man  can  have  for
himself."
In front of Hegel,  Kierkegaard  brandished  a terrible  threat: to send him

Dostoyevsky , after his admirable  Speech  on Pushkin':  "For what I said

Marseille.

Algiers  to Kairouan.4  Double  spray. The foam and crackle  of the first
wave to break against  the ship-and all at once a violent  wind blows,  twists,
wrings  the air; and a second  spray, not as thick with water, laced with a
fine vapor , thickens the mist.

The soldiers  on the bridge,  beneath  the wind, pressed  against  the ropes,
their heads wrapped  with scarves,  their capotes  shapeless.  These moments
where man abandons  demonstra tion and presses  at the level of need, this
is history .
Motionless  over the upper bridge,  the gulls descend  and continue  their
patient,  flight close to me. The obstinate  gulls with their globular  eyes,
their sorcerer's beak, their tireless  muscles.  The seagulls  have nowhere  to
rest other than the waves'  changing  hollow  or the tall mast's oscillating
cross.

Tipasa: The sky grey and soft. At the center of the ruins, the slightly

enormous  and light. I will die, and this place will continue  to dole out
plenitude  and beauty. Nothing  bitter about this idea, but on the contrary , a
feeling of gratitude and veneration.
Algiers' heavy , vertical rain. Endless. In a cage.
Algerians.  They  live  in  the  richness  and  warmth  of  friendship  and
family. The body as the center, and its virtues-and  its profound  sadness  as
soon as it declines-life  without  a view other than the immediate  one, than
the physical  circle. Proud of their virility, of their capacity  for eating and
drinking, of their strength and their courage.  Vulnerable.

The stabbed dove.
Return.  Kairouan.  Storm.  Irresistible  impulse  to throw myself  into the
water. The solitude  and resignation  of a man alone in the raging seawaters
behind a ship pursuing its path.
Stages of healing.
Letting volition sleep. Enough of "you must."
Completely depoliticize the mind in order to humanize it.
Write the claustrophobic-and comedies.
Deal with death, which is to say , accept it.
Accept  making a spectacle  of yourself. I will not die of this anguish. If I
died  from  it,  the  end.  Otherw ise,  at  worst,  shortsighted  behavior .  It
suffices  to  accept  others'  judgment.  Humility  and  acceptance:  purely
medical remedies of anguish.
The world moves  toward  paganism but it still rejects  pagan values.
They must be restored,  to paganize  belief,  Graecize  Christ  and restore
balance.
Wouldn't  it  be  that  I  have  suffered  from  the  excess  of  my
responsibilities?
Since I am in the desert and lifelessness,  I must push aridity all the way
to the end so that the threshold  is reached  and, one way or another , crossed
over. Madness or complete control.
Method:  as soon as the appearance  of anguished  breathing  accelerated
or slowed  down the warning.  Thereto  associating  immediate  deprivation
of every action and every gesture.
Second association: general relaxation.

In  the  long  run:  transfer  and  accumulation  of  the  energy  that  is
characteristic  of all want or desire by the temporary  suspension  of this
want and this desire.
With regard  to society, recogni ze that I expect  nothing  from it. Any
participation  then becomes  a gift that does not await repayment . Praise or
blame then become  what they are: nothing.  Finally, suppression  of the
conformist.
Eliminate the brooding morals from abstract justice.
Remain  close to the reality  of beings  and things.  Return  as often as
possible  to personal  happiness.  Not refusing  to recognize  what is true even
when  the  truth  happens  to  thwart  the  desirable.  Ex.:  recognizing  that
power, it also, it especially , persuades.  The truth is worth all the torments.
It alone establishes the joy that must crown this ef fort.
Recover ener gy-as the central force.
Recognize the need for enemies. Love that they exist.
Systematically  shatter  automatisms  from smallest  to largest. Tobacco,
food, sex, emotional reactions  of defense  (or of attack.  They are the same
thing) and creation itself. Asceticism  not out of the desire that must be
kept intact, but out of its satisfaction.
Recover the greatest strength, not to dominate but to give.
May 3.
Almost  a total recovery;  I even hope for increased  strength.  Understand
better now what I have always  known: the one who drags through his life,
and succumbs under its weight,  cannot  help anyone  with the few duties he
does take on. The one who controls himself  and controls  his life can be
truly generous,  and give without effort, expecting  nothing  and asking  for
nothing but this strength to give and to work.

The light-the light-and the anxiety  retreat,  not yet gone, but dulled,  as if
put to sleep by the heat and sun.
April :30.
Martin  du Gard. Nice. He straggles along with his rheumatoid  arthritis.
77 years old. "In the face of death nothing  prevails,  not even my work.
There is nothing,  nothing...."  "Yes, it is good not to feel alone" (and his
eyes fill with tears). We set a rendezvous  for July at Tertre.8  "If I am
alive." But always this same heart interested in everything.
May 29, 1958.
My job is to make my books and to fight when the freedom  of my own
and my people is threatened.  That's all.
The artist is like the god of Delphi: "He does not show nor does he
hide: he signifies."
Chekhov:  "I  am  neither  a  liberal  nor  a  conservative....  My  holy  of
holies is the human  body, health,  intelligence,  talent, inspiration,  love, and
absolute  freedom.  The  freedom   from  all  brute  force  and  all  lies,  in
whatever manner they are expressed:
That is what my agenda  would  be if I were a great artist" (letter to
Pleshcheyev .`'  1888).

Musil':  a great project  that supposes  all the means of art, which he does
not have. Hence  this work is moving  by its failures,  not by what it says.
This author's  interminable  monologue,  where the genius  shines  in some
passages, and where art never shines in its entirety .
Musil. "Each one of us possesses  a second  nature where everything  that
he does is innocent."
"Ordinary life is the average of all our possible crimes."
Maman.  If we loved enough  those whom we love, we would prevent
them from dying.

New departure for Greece.2
June 10.
Acropolis.  The feeling  is not as great as the first time. I was not alone,
and so I preoccupied  myself  with my com pany. And then the meeting
with 0., which bothers  me. The Acropolis  is not a place where one could
lie. At  two  o'clock,  the  airplane  to  Rhodes.  Islands,  rocks  on  the  sea,
drifting  off behind  us. Pulveriza tion of continents.  In Rhodes,  we land in
the middle  of fields where short flowery  wheat grows,  which the wind
moves  in  waves  toward  the  blue  sea.  Sumptuous,  florid  island.  The
promenade  at night, in the center of the Frankish  architecture.  Encounter
with R. P. Bruckber ger, who announces  to me his intention  to break with
the Church  without  defrocking.  My liking for him always  alive. Boat with
Michel G. and Prassinos.
June 11.
I get off the boat in the early morning,  alone, and go to wash on the
beach of Rhodes  twenty  minutes  away, alone. The water is clear, fresh.

The sun, at the beginning  of its trip, warms  without  burning.  Delectable
moments  that remind  me of Madrague  mornings,  twenty  years ago, when I
used to leave the tent, sleepily , a few meters  from the sea, to plunge  into
the somnolent  morning  water.'  Alas, I can no longer swim. Or rather, I can
no longer breathe as I used to. Nevertheless,  I regret leaving  the beach
where I have just been happy .
At ten o'clock  we leave Rhodes  to pass the northern  point, of the island
and to arrive near Lindos.
12:30 Lindos.
Small,  natural port, almost  enclosed.  Perfect  bay. We lose an anchor  in
the absolutely clear waters.  Initially , the bay is dominated  by the village's
white houses, then by the Acropolis,  fortified  by medieval  ramparts in the
middle of which rise Doric columns.
We reach the beach in a dinghy. Swim. At the end of the afternoon  we
climb toward the Acropolis.  Over the top, wide, steep stairs lead to an
immense  midair space, which on one side dominates  the port where we
are  anchored,  and  on  the  other,  a  balanced,  dizzying  void,  another
enclosed  cove, the one where  Saint Paul landed.  Above  this space the
swallows  turn, drunk with light, plunge  vertically  into the void and climb
back up with piercing  cries. The day ends over the columns,  the two bays,
the capes that multiply  all the way to the horizon  and the immense  sea
before  us. Feeling  of powerless ness to join, to express  so much beauty.
But at the same time, recognition  before the world's  perfect  state. Back in
the city, the young  donkeys,  the rowboat  in the evening  ... During  the
night, the donkeys' loud braying.
June 12.
At six o'clock  I climb onto the deck one last time to see the bay that I
love. Everyone  on board is asleep except the captain.  In the mild morning,

the scent of Lindos,  scent of froth, of heat, of donkeys  and grass, of smoke
...
Rhodes at 8:30  A.M.
Stroll to see a gorge full of freshly  hatched  butterflies.  They are nestled
in the grass, the trees, the caves,  and before  our steps they disperse  in
silent and bustling  clouds.  Crushing  heat. Return.  Depart  for Marmaris,  a
Turkish port, at three P.M. Arrive at five P.M. The bay we are anchored  in
the middle of is beautiful  but somber . The little town, from afar, looks
pathetic.  And little by little we see all the inhab itants gathering  on the
pier.  The  Turkish  police  and  customs  officers  arrive  on  board.
Interminable  discussions  to  settle  the  customary  formalities.  Then  we
disembark  and are surrounded  by a crowd  of disheveled  children.  The
poverty , the dereliction  of the streets and houses  makes the heart ache so
much so that we return without  waiting  any longer. After dinner, another
visit from the officials.  More discussions  (they do not speak any Western
language),  interminable.  They kept the passports,  etc. We will get them at
six o'clock in the morning.  The captain  protests  . . . etc. We will actually
have to go to pick them up the next morning.
June 1:1.
Depart  at  seven  o'  clock.  At  eleven  o'  clock,  the  island  of  Synri.
Admirable  Greek cleanliness.  The poorest  houses  are freshly  painted  with
lime, decorated,  etc. Unbelievab le and revolting  that the Turks could have
dominated  these  people  for  such  a  long  time.  Swim.  But  growing
claustrophobia.  For everything  else, superb  form. At three t'.w we again
set out for Kos.
Kos.  Small  port  where  life  is  easy  at  night.  Music.  The  radio's
loudspeakers  shout the events of Cyprus  with a tone I know all too well.
We dine beneath a pink light.

June 14.
The island.  Small temple  on a beach with clear water. Swine and lunch
in Psameros.  In the small cove, five houses  painted  with lime, white and
blue. The little girls get in the water in their shirts and swim toward us.
Every day, the monstrous  sun ... not heavy nor veiled by mist, but clear
and pure, hurling all its heat, ferocious ...
To Kalymnos  at six P.M. The sea is covered  with short, cool waves....
Dozens  of  children  with  round  heads  escort  us.  Katina.  June  15,  the
following  day, she runs all the way to the pass and again, for a long time,
waves  her hand. Noon swim in Leros.  Then toward  Patmos  where  we
enter a bay that is almost entirely protected.  The evening hour .
June 16.
Climb upon mules and donkeys  toward  Patmos  and the Monastery  of
St. Jean de P. From up there, the two isthmuses.  The violent  northern wind
(the meltem) picked up. The Greek mistral  has the same effects: it brushes
the sky and brings forth a purified  light, clear, taut, almost  metallic.  But it
prevents us from returning to the sea; we have to wait here until it calms.
June 17.
Depart  at six o'clock  in the morning  under the meltem  to head toward
Gaidaros.  But the sea is furious.  Shaken  for three hours by big waves-
everybody  on  board  sick  or  sallow-the  boat  is  diverted  to  the  Fourni
Islands.  Shelter  in a deserted  cove where the wind blows less, but it blows.
Day of waiting.  Toward the evening  the wind dies down a little, but it is
too late to leave.
June 18.

The wind, which picked  up again during the night, now blows violently .
We waive departure. Then, since nothing  changes  and the bread is running
out-the  water  soon-we  decide  to  leave  around  six  P.M.,  regardless.
Everyone  in the cockpit.  Heavy squalls,  but we arrive in eyeshot  of the
fires of  Tigani (ancient Samos) around eight-thirty P .M.
Gentleness of the small port, quiet in the night, after the violent sea.
June 19.
In the morning  I go for a swim alone. Depart  by car to visit the island.
One of the most beautiful  because  of the great abundance  of olive trees
and filiform  cypresses  that furnish the slopes of the hills and mountains
toward  the sea. After having  taken a dip, we lunch in a small village on the
southern  coast. The table is outside. A crowd  of beautiful  children play
around  us, then come to look at us. One of the little girls, Matina, with
golden  eyes, touches  my heart. When we leave, she comes close to the car
and I take her small hand. Toward the evening,  the Heraion,  the crushed
temple  whose  formidable  debris-scattered  in front of the sea among  the
reeds and oats, in the middle  of an admirable  landscape  of mountains and
sea-has  itself been destroyed  by the recent earthquakes.  In a nearby  cafe,
where our drivers  offer us a drink, they begin to dance together  to the
sound of a radio, for their pleasure and ours.
Polycrates,  tyrant of Samos,  "brilliant  statesmen  and depraved  tyrant."
Frightened  by  his  own  luck-insolent,  perpetual-and  by  his  unflinching
successes  and his fabulous  wealth, he threw an expensive  ring that he
wore on his finger into the sea in order to beseech  fate. But a fish served
on his table returned  to him this ring that it had swallowed.  Completed  the
Heraion,  held a sumptuous  court where the arts held great importance.
Perished crucified by the strategic Croites who lured him into a trap (522).
June 20.

Day at sea toward  Chios. In the morning  a manatee  beneath  the bow. It
rolls, moves forward,  waddles  with a mocking  air, then plunges  toward  the
depths.  A little later, a few miles from shore, the scent of rosebays comes
to us on the wind. Afternoon  of sun and swimming  in a cove where the
water is ethereal  due to its clarity;  we enter Chios on a beautiful  and quiet
evening.
June 21.
Chios. Turkish quarter. Crossing  the island.  The enormous  cinder-block
houses.  Red soil. Enormous  olive trees. The peasants  beating  wheat with
their mules'  hooves,  beneath  a blinding  heat. The summer  of massacres.4
Finally,  the  leprosarium,  in  a  narrow  ravine  planted  with  eucalyptus,
deadending  in an impasse  of rocks. Series of long dilapidated  brown and
dark green buildings.  Retired  in the unfolding  evening  to their rooms with
large iron beds covered  with coarse  brown  blankets.  11 leprous  women
and 3 leprous  men roam beneath  the verandas.  Some have lost fingers.
Others  with large turbid eyes, yellow, without  pupils or eyeballs,  like an
enormous,  rotten drop of water. Their natural  gaiety beneath  their thick,
greyish  clothes  of infinite  poverty. One of them complains  that somebody
wants  to  remove  them  from  this  miserable  place  to  move  them
elsewhere.... Evening dances and laughter very late into the night.
June 22.
Toward Mytilen e. Vast indentation  of bays and beaches.  The olive trees
go down almost  to the sea. P. is sick. Doctor  (Paritis).  Ascent  to Ayassos.
Dip. I swim a little. Depart  along the side of the island.  At the end of the
afternoon  hundreds  of  terns,  flying  over  the  surface  of  the  still  water,
again rise by the boat.  Arrival at Sigris.
(We arrive in the ports at sunset. And at times the sun masked  the port
from us, then disappeared  behind  the hill, and in the twilight  the port
appeared....  ) Signs.  Return  to Sigris.  Two enclosed  bays. Naked  hills.

Smooth  water,  evening  light. The  world  and  life  end  here. And  begin
again.
The village,  viewed  from the boat at night, is illuminated  by Saint-
Jean's fires.5
Depart  during  the night. Michel and I take the midnight  watch.  Night
on  the  sea,  immense  after  the  crescent  moon  sets  in  the  west.  The
constellations  descend  toward  the horizon.  Unforeseen  islands  take shape
in the shadows  on the horizon.  In the morning,  Skyros,  layered  over its
crests.
Depart  at  three  P.M.  for  Skopelos.  In  the  afternoon,  the  Northern
Sporades.  One, two, five, ten, fourteen  islands  appear  on the sea. Skopelos
at  night  and  its  roofs'  edges  are  underlined  with  lime.  Jasmine,
pomegranates,  hibiscus.  Peaceful  night. In the morning  Skiatho s, and we
take the Euripus Strait.
June 26.
Khalkis.  Preface   Grenier6:  "each  conscienc e  wants  the  death  of  the
other." But no. Master  and slave. Master  and disciple.  History  was built on
admiration as much as on hatred.
For this book I want the young  reader  who resembles  the one that I
used to be.
Like that quest from island to island that Melville  illustrated  in Mardi,
this one ends in a meditation on the absolute and the Divine.
Khalkis.  At  night,  vast  and  silent  Bay  of  Marathon.  The  waters
suddenly  settle. Only a brief and heavy surf. And night falls over the
immense  corrie  of  mountains  and  over  the  suddenly  mysterious  bay.
Beauty sleeps on the waters.
June 27.

In  the  early  morning,  while  the  cicadas  begin  to  shriek  in  the
surrounding  hills, swim in the still and fresh water. Then the sea and at
twelve  o'clock,  Kea,  the  island  with  green  rocks,  large  pasty  oysters
beneath  the slightly  veiled sky. But during  the night the southern  wind
picks up, and the next day, the 28th, we are stuck in Kea. 29th. Depart  in
the morning on bad waters.  Sounion.  Light. Hydra,  Spetsai  for the night.
30th. Poros, Egine and again Ayia Marina  like four years ago. Marvelous
island at the center of a whirling of light and space. Return there.
July 1st.
Athens.  Heat.  Dust.  Idiotic  hotel.  Fatigued.  2nd.  Delphi.  Again  the
extraordinary  rise in light levels. I lay my feet in my footstep s. Evening
scent over the small stage. 3rd. Return  to Corinth.  Until Patras.  Alone,
quick  dip,  the  water  ...  Patras:  large,  dusty  Oran,  ugly  and  alive.  4th.
Olympia.  5th. Mycenae,  Argos. The tall pines of Olympia  crackle  with
cicadas.  Greece  bursting  with sonorous  braying  in the valley hollows,  on
the slopes of the island.
Pavese.7  As if the sole reason  why we always  think about ourselves  is
that we have to stay with ourselves longer  than with anyone  else. As if
genius  is  fecundity .  To  he  is  to  express,  to  express  constantly .  As  if
idleness  makes  the hours slow and the years fast, and activity  makes  the
hours  brief  and  the  years  slow. As  if  all  libertines  are  sentimentalists
because  for them the relationshi ps between  men and women  are an object
of emotion, not of duty .
Id. "When a woman  marries,  she belongs  to another , and when she
belongs to another , there is no longer anything to say to him."
Id. The old Mentina woman,  who for seventy  years has ignored  history.
She has lived a "static and immobile  life." That gives Pavese  the shivers.
And what if the old Mentina woman had been his mother?
Live  in  and  for  the  truth. The  truth  of  what  we  are  foremost.  Quit
compromising  with people.  The truth of what is. Don't be tricky with

reality. Accept then its originality  and its impotency . Live according  to this
originality  until this impotency . At the center, creation  with the immense
force of the person finally being respected.
Return.  Lunch with A.M. He tells me that Massu and two or three of his
collaborators  have submitted  to torture  in order to have the right to ... (The
difference: they chose it.  There is no humiliation.) Strange impression.
Since  returning  from  Greece  ten  days  ago,  bodily  strength  and  joy.
Sleep of the soul and heart. In the depths,  the convent  sleeps,  the strong
and bare house where silence contemplates.
The  lie  lulls  or  dreams,  like  illusion.  The  truth  is  the  only  power,
cheerful,  inexhaustible.  If we were able to live only of, and for truth:
young and immortal  energy in us. The man of truth does not age. A little
more ef fort, and he will not die.

Letter to Amrouche
November 19
My Dear  Amrouche, I
It's time-and  health-that  has kept me from responding  to you. It was
necessary  to respond  at length,  and I wasn't even able to keep up with my
ordinary  mail. Today I am no better able to do so. But I don't want to delay
in thanking you for your second letter, which touched  me. I owe you,
however , the truth about what I think. Personal  questions  cannot  separate
us. What are they in the face of what is happening  and about to happen?
But I was painfully shocked  by what you wrote,  on several  occasions,
about French-Al gerians  in general  (in Le Monde  and in Commune). You
have the right to choose  the positions  of the F.L.N. For my part, I think of
them as murderous  in the present,  blind and dangerous  in the future.  But
even while placing  yourself  on this side, you must make the necessary
distinctions,  which you  have not done. I have given up on trying to make a
voice of reason heard publicly . I hope, against  all hope, to one day be able
to do so. But, in private,  I must tell you my reaction,  and you should  not
ignore the shooting,  nor justify that they shoot at the French-Algerians  in
general,  and thus entangled,  shoot at my family, who have always  been
poor and without  hatred  and who should  not be mixed  up in an unjust
rebellion.  No cause, even if it had remained  innocent  and just, will ever
tear me from my mother, who is the greatest  cause that I know in the
world.'

In this sincere  language,  I know you will again find an echo of past
fraternities.  Can  they  inspire  you  to  work  toward  appeasement  and
assembly , rather than toward  fratricidal  separation;  that is the wish that
forms, from the bottom of his heart, your brother of birth and sky .
Albert Camus
Letter to Anonymous
April 3
Monsieur ,
My poor health has delayed  this reply, and I apologize  for that. More
than a year ago, after having  recognized  what irremediably  separates  me
from the left as well as from the right with regard to the Algerian  question,
I decided no longer to associate  myself  with any public campaign  on this
subject.  Collective  signatures-t hese  ambiguous  alliances  between  men,
which all, by the way, break apart-lead to confusions  that largely overflow
and  consequently  compromise  the  objective  they  mean  to  serve.  Even
when this objective  is valid, as is the case, I have consequently  decided  no
longer  to act except  personally , under the conditions  and at the moment
that I deem useful, no matter what pressures are exerted upon me.
Moreover , I intend to handle  the questions  that interest  you in a book
that will come out soon and that will speak for me alone. In any case, I
entrust  this personal response  to your loyalty, and ask you to accept  my
sincere regards.
Albert Camus
Letter to Guerin3
June 9, 1954
My Dear Guerin,

Your article from the Parisian  (I do not read this journal  and I am not
subscribed  to Argus) was passed  on to me. No, it is not "ingratitude,"  nor
"rigor,"  that  I  reproach  you  for.  I  do  not  like  the  place,  nor  the
discourteous  manner, in which they are expressed.  I do not like either that
you speak of things that you do not know, by which I mean to say of my
life. If you knew my life, you would have kept silent about this point. But
as for content,  you have the right to say that you do not like what I publish
and to say it openly .
What  I  reproac h  you  for  is  an  unspeakable  breach  of  the  custom
whereby  a  personal  letter  cannot  be  published  without  the  sender's
authorization.  I did not write to you, at the time when I did, so that my
trusting  letters,  written  with freedom  of heart, would ten years later be laid
out in public.  You have the right to divulge  your own secrets  to that public
and to speak with complete  freedom  about those who were your friends,
but you do not have the right to force those friends  to divulge  their own
secrets.  By reading  those sentences  of affectionate  camaraderie,  written  to
a friend in pain, in the place where you have printed  them, an intolerable
embarrassment  has come to me and a sort of disgust  that you should  have
perceived  in advance  and which I do not forgive you for having  inflicted
upon me.
I cannot, in any case, let you go unaware of my feeling on this point.
yours
Albert Camus
Letter to Anonymous
July 20, 1956
Madame,
I am very sorry about what you have told me. And even more so since it
undoubtedly concerns, I assure you, a misunderstanding.

I might have met the doctor whose name you mentioned,  but this name
means nothing  to me. Thus, he is not one of my friends.  And in any case I
do not know this doctor well enough that he could ever take the liberty  to
reveal a secret concerning  a third party. Besides,  supposing  that this secret
were divulged  to me, to imagine  that I could have used it without  care is
not to know me very well.
I assure you on my honor that the details  described  in The Fall pertain
only to me. Your friend is not the only one who likes the high plateaus.  I
love them and I have lived there. Once tubercular , I in fact suffer from a
pulmonary  sclerosis  that  has  made  me  claustrophobic.  Those  who
surround  me can confirm  my fear of pits, caves, and all enclosed places,
which comes from this quite personal infirmity . People  often joke with me
about my impatience  with speleologists,  about my sadness  in the deep
alpine  valleys,  etc.  As  such,  every  detail  that  struck  your  friend  can
receive  an  irrefutable  explanat ion.  As  for  the  principle  anecdote,  you
understand  that I do not come to divulge  secrets  here. Let me, however ,
quote for you a sentence  from a letter I received  from one of my friends
the other day: "Each one of us, without  exception,  thus has a girl in his life
whom he did not rescue."
This is clear evidence,  and your friend must convince  himself  of this
evidence.  You say that he has always  read me with regard  and particular
interest.  Then he is aware that I am unable to lie about such a matter .
It  is  on  my  honor,  I  repeat,  that  I  assure  him  that  he  has  nothing,
absolutely  nothing,  to do with my character . He has not been betrayed  by
anyone,  and if he is what I imagine  he is, he will give back to his friends
this  confidence  of  heart  without  which  every  life  is  an  exhausting
unhappiness.
A primary cause of the doubt from which your friend suffers today is
the exhausting  life that we all lead, and particularly  so for those who add
the stress of a personal  work to the interminable  weight  of modern life.
How could I not understand?  Sometimes  my days end with clenched  teeth,
and I often have the impression  of walking  and working  by pure will that

alone  holds  me  up.  But  in  these  cases  we  must  agree  to  be  easy  on
ourselves  and our own nature.  We must return to a more animalistic  life, at
rest, in solitude.
I hope that your friend,  enlightened  by my testimony , will again find
rest  and  peace.  I  will  then  comfort  myself  in  having,  without  having
wanted  to, rid a virtuous  heart of its turmoil.  For the time being I feel only
sad to have done harm with one of my books,  as I have always thought
that art was nothing if, finally , it did not do good, if it did not help.
Letter to M. R.P .
M. R.P.
I received your letter very late, and the news of my friend's  brutal death'
that  you've  delivered  to  me  hits  hard  even  though  it's  all  over  with.
Nevertheless,  I want to thank you, from the bottom  of my heart, for having
thought  of me. Didier was a part of my childhood  and my youth, and when
I encountered  him again later as a man of religion,  I had no trouble  liking
once again what he had never ceased  to be. Because  he had remained the
same child, become  the same man, with the same faith, purer and deeper,
and with the same fidelity. The discretion  and constant  sensitivity  that he
brought  to our relationship,  far too distanced  by our different lives, could
only enrich and render  our childhood friendship  that much more tender.
This end, so sudden,  so unexpec ted, is a great sorrow  for me. For the last
few hours, the world has been poorer  in my eyes. I am aware that for him
death was only a passage;  he spoke knowingly  of a certain  hope. But for
those who, like me, have loved him without  being able to share this hope,
the grief is allencompassing.  You are right: he remains  a memory  and an
example.  Know that, with gratitude, I transfer  a part of our long friendship
onto those who have loved him and had the joy of living near him, and do
not doubt my faithful feelings from now on.
A.C.

In  the  hospital  X.  discovered  something  that  I  have  always  known
(because  of a similar  experience  [...]5  youthbecause  of other things  as
well)  the  solidarity  of  bodies,  unity  at  the  center  of  the  mortal  and
suffering flesh. This is what we are and nothing  else. We are this plus
human genius in all its forms, from the child to Einstein.
No,  dear  Dominique,  it  is  not  humiliating  to  be  unhappy .  Physical
suffering is sometimes  humiliati ng, but the suffering of being cannot  be, it
is life, just like this happiness  that Bernard  speaks  of in his text with a
conviction that so violently moved me.
I hesitate  to tell you, but what you must do now is nothing  more than
live like everybody  else. You deserve,  by what you are, a happiness,  a
fullness  that few people  know. Yet today this fullness  is not dead, it is a
part of life and, to its credit, it reigns over you whether  you want it to or
not.  But  in  the  coming  days  you  must  live  alone,  with  this  hole,  this
painful  memory . This lifelessness  that we all carry inside of us-by us, I
mean to say those who are not taken to the height of happiness , and who
painfully  remember  another  kind  of  happiness  that  goes  beyond'i  the
memory .
Sometimes,  for violent  minds,  the time that we tear off for work, that is
torn away from time, is the best.  An unfortunate passion.

Well! You don't want to come?
Albert I'm going to smack you.
He is like my brother, and in my family  whoever  touches  my brother  is

Fame is a convent.
X.  Initiation  by  his  mother's  gymnastics  teacher.  Upon  his  mother's
request,  the gymnastics  teacher  arranges  a course  of sexual  initiation  for
him (at 15 years old), then persuades  her that it is better that the thing be
done by an expert....
X. His rotund  comrade  repeats  a sentence  from the novel he is reading:
"Live each hour as if it were to be the last and most beautiful,"  and he
writes:  "That's  it exactly." But, X. says: he doesn't  even leave his room to
visit the city , and he divides his time between fine meals and his bed.
At heart, X. says, we are like these Christians.  Pagans,  well, everyone,
but we profess  our paganism  on the tip of the tongue,  even him. Her
companion-with  his athletic  [. . .]9-cannot  make love before  the match,
because  he muse keep his strength, nor after, because  he does not have any
left; for the same reasons,  he does not go out. In the morning,  he wakes
her  with  a  knee  to  the  small  of  the  back  so  that  she  will  go  make
breakfast....  She: "I don't have sex, I don't go out, I'm the maid, and this
has gone on for three years."
From the prison's ink on the slave's chains to the
gentle faces of the executed I write your name
Liberty'
The strokes of your letters are bars your face is
a bolt fraternal to the executioners On the gate's
command I write your name Liberty Liberty ,
betrayed liberty  Where are your defenders? In
the cellar's darkness  Your gentle eyes crackle I
write your name Kalande dies  Writing is easy
dying is terrible I write, I write I write your
adulterous name Over yours which despairs
Oh! What have you done with my young
Kalande?  We die naked

When your brothers kill you I write your
sonorous name In an ink that disgraces
To bar the future  To scratch out the memory I
write your name Liberty In capitals of pain.
Pierre Serment

July 1 9 5 8 - December 1 9 5 9
July 21. Alone all day to reflect.  Evening  dinner with B.M.'  In M.'s place
inside me, all day , an emptiness that upsets me. I write to her .
22.24.
Nothing.  Recorded Fall on my tape recorder . Mi's letter ("violent and
pure  nights").  Wandered  yesterday  evening  in  St  Germain-des-Pres-
awaiting  what? Spoke with a drunk painter  "What do you do for a living-
I'm  not  in  prisonthat's  negative-no  it's  positive"  and  he  swallows  five
hardboiled  eggs  sprinkled  with  cognac.  Distressed  by  my  inability  to
work. Fortunately  Zhivago2  and the fondness  I feel for its author. Gave up
trip to the Midi.
25.
Nothing.  Recording  Fall.  Possessed  distributed.  N.R.F.  Dinner  with
A.C. His romance with M., impotent with his wife, which M. reveals  to
her. "He is better," she says-"that  is" - "Well, he is not yet a man, but he is
no longer  an old man either." This pool of shadows  over their lives. All
lives. After having  accompanied  her back, I stroll in St Germain-desPres.  I
wait, stupidly. Ah! if the strength  to work returned  to me, it would be the
light, finally. The little punks,  dressed up like James Dean, and the gesture
of  the  hand,  like  a  spoon,  their  ring  fingers  arranging  their  genitals,
apparently  wedged too tightly  in their blue jeans. I think of the naked
brown bodies, ages ago, in my lost country . They were pure.
26.

Recording  Fall. Barely  begun the preface  for Islands.'  Dinner  with C.,
lazy and cynical,  turned  only toward  pleasure.  But he is self-employed.
Also, a second- rate writer. But he bears no resemblance  to anybody . I
leave him early. He goes to play poker, which bores me, and I go home.
Earlier:  a rather inelegant  girl, pursued  by an Arab, rejects  him. "I am
racist," she says simply .
27.
Finished  recording  Fall. Don Giovanni.  Grey sky all day. Evening  film
about soccer's  World Cup. The young  Black Brazilians  crying  after the
victory  and trying to hide their faces from the camera.  As before,  this still
touches and moves me.
28.
Dinner  B.M. A.C. joins us. A storm weighs  over the cityand  does not
break.
29.
Algeria  obsesses  me this morning.  Too late, too late ... My land lost, I
would be worth nothing.
July 30.
Solitary  day. Shapeless  work. The evening,  through  Nabokov , Narayan-
who could be Gandhi's  successor -explains  to us the movement  of villager
and agrarian  socialism  in the Indies (Vinoba).4  I admire, distantly . Back
home, passing  in front of the Aiglon, I see A.M.'s  name on the illuminated
marquee.  I enter. Eleven  years ago, I had happiness  with her. Married now
to an Air France  steward,  with whom  she goes fishing.  And she sings
every evening.

July 31.
In the afternoon , A.M. comes to see me for a half-hour . In the daylight,
I see the traces left by eleven years. She was 22 years old, therefore  she is
33. But we laugh a lot together .
August 1st.
Lunch  at Barrault's  place in Chambourcy . The sky is constantly  black
from a storm that never breaks.  B. again proposes  to me the Dantchenko-
Stanislavski5  association.  In  the  afternoon  Colin  Wilsonti  -  A  baby;
obviously  Europe  has conquered  England.  "We must now communicate
faith in [. . .]7  [ know it well. This faith is mine; it has never left me. But I
have taken the path of the era-with  its frustrations-so  as not to cheat and
affirm after having shared  in suffering and denial,  just as I had actually
felt it. Now we must transfigure , and this is what distresses  me in the face
of this book that I must make and that binds me. Perhaps  the painting,  of a
certain  distress  has completely  exhausted  the men of my age and we will
no longer be able to speak our true faith. We will only have prepared  the
terrain for the boys who follow us. I say to C.W. and "if I did not succeed,
I'll have been an interesting  witness, at best. If I did succeed,  I'll have been
a creator ."
In the evening  I dine with A.E. and Karin,  then stroll to Montmartre
with just Karin. The gardens  in the night, washed  beneath  the moon but
dark. Karin is 18 years old. Parents divorced.  She left Sweden,  I don't
know why, and earned  her living as a model  for a second-rate  designer
who exploited  her. Thirty-five  thousand  francs for seven hours of work a
day. The courage  of these girls of the half-century , it always  fills me with
the same admiration.  Beauty  a little boyish,  but slow, as if absent. Return.
Her naturalness.  She immediatel y advances  her tender mouth,  then leaves,
precise and reserved.
August 2.

I force myself  to write this diary, but my reluctance  is exquisite.  I know
now why I never kept a personal  diary: for me life is secretive. With
respect  to others (and that is what pained  X. so much) but also, life must
be lived through  my own eyes, I must not reveal it in words.  Unheard  and
unexposed,  like this it is rich for me. If I force myself  to keep a personal
diary at this moment, it is out of panic in the face of my failing memory .
But I am not sure I can continu e. Besides,  even so, I forget to note many
things.  And I say nothing  of what I think. Hence  my long reflection  in
regard to K.
Saturday 2.
The evening, M. at the train station  until Sunday  evening.  Fatigued and
distant.  Toward the evening she resuscitates and I am happy about this.
Monday 4.
Lunch M. Afternoon  Doctor  X. According  to him, because  I must save
X.'s health, this makes me live "in a glass ball." His prescription : freedom
and  selfishness.  Superb  prescription,  I  say.  And  by  far  the  easiest  to
follow."  Evening K.
Tuesday 5.
Afternoon  M. Long conversation.  Few people  have gone further  than
her in the acceptance  of life. The 6th. Go out in the evening  with Michel,
Anne, and M. Dance.  The 7th. Again the feeling  of distance  from M. The
most passionate  person  whom I have known  is in fact the most chaste.
Dinner  with the Russian  nurse and her nine-year -old girl at Brice Parain's9
place. B.P., like all religious  minds,  tries to just'ify  all misfortunes  by the
necessary  atonement.  I tell him that, in any case, we meet all that is worst
in dialectics. He knows this. He reflects.
Friday 8.

Solitary  day like most of the preceding  ones. I try to organize my work.
It  has  rained  for  2  days.  Letter  from  X.:  "well-oiled  and  informal
conversations" (on the telephone).  Warm, free, truthful.
Sunday 9.1
Sick. Sunday the 10th. Monday  the 11th. La Corde.  I lie down and fall
asleep with a dreadful  headache.  Bad night. During  the day Mi telephones
from Marseille;  she runs from one city to the next, pursued  by anguish  and
panic. I advise her to return to Paris.
Tuesday 12.
In the morning  C. comes to see me. Wednesday  the 13th. Lunch Char.
We laugh a lot. Afternoon  Ivernel.2  Evening  dinner  and golf with M.G.,
Anne, and R.G. Evening  on the prairies.  Thursday  the 14th. Ivernel  on the
telephone.  He spent all night reading  my adaptation  of Possessed  without
being able to put it down. He agrees  to play the part of Shatov. Evening
dinner with R. Physically , he has been the same for the past 20 years. But
since his nervous  breakdown  the drive has disappeared.  He lives by heart
alone, obviously . We bump into K. Her naturalness  suffocates  me (the
unreserved  hand and then come along, no why, I have an appointment) she
eats nonstop.
August 15, 16, 17.
This whole period  since the 2nd is in fact empty. One cannot  write
without  recoveri ng vitality  and energy-the heart's health-even  if what one
must  say  is  tragic.  Particularly  so.  Finished  Zhivago  with  a  sort  of
tenderness  for the author. It's not true that this book again takes up the
XIXth  century's  Russian  artistic  tradition.  It's  much  more  gauche  and
modern  in composition,  with its continual  snapshots.  But he does better:
he  resuscitates  the  Russian  heart,  crushed  beneath  forty  years  of
watchwords  and humanitarian  cruelties.  Zhivago  is a book of love. And of

such love that it is poured  out upon all people  at the same time. The doctor
loves his wife, and Lara, and others still, and Russia.  If he dies, he is to be
separated from his wife, from Lara, from Russia, and from all the rest.
People without name are near to me  Trees,
children, and sedentaries I am overcome by all
of these  And that alone is my victory .'
And Pasternak's  courage  was to rediscover  this true source  of creation
and to work at it slowly  in order to make it gush out in the middle  of the
desert.
What else? the evenings  of the 16th and the 15th, recorded  The Poems
of Char with M. Night of the 15th, stroll along the Seine. Beneath the Pont
Neuf young foreigners  (Scandinavians)  are joined together  around two of
their own, a trumpeter  and a banjo player, and lie on the street, couples
embracing,  listening  to the improvisation.  Farther, on one of the benches
of the Pont des Arts, an Arab has stretched  out, a portable  radio by his
head, playing Arab music to him. The Pont de la Cite, beneath  Paris' warm
and hazy  August sky .
For Julia. Guibert  is the noble progressive.  Mora the face of the old
world.4
August 18.
Lunch M. Meet again. Evening dinner R. Depression not improved.
19.
Letter from X. which saddens me once again.
Evenings of the 21st-23rd.

Mi. Fills these days with beauty, with gentleness.  Far from taking me
away from work, this long joy turns me toward  it. Her 22-year -old sister
dies  from  liver  cancer.  Her  father  orders  her  to  admire  the  sunsets:
"because you are an artist."
August 23.
Death of Roger Martin  du Gard. I had postponed  my visit to Belleme
and suddenly  ... I again see this man, whom I loved tenderly , speaking  to
me in Nice, in May, of his solitude, and of death. He dragged  his large
heavy body, hunched  over, from the table to the armchair . And his good
looks ... One could love and respect him. Grief.
25.
Dinner  Brisville5  (and Therese).  B.M.  (and Vivette6).  Go  out  for  a
stroll. The chapel and over the outer boulevards. Sordid Paris.
26-29.
Giacometti's  example.  Ah! and then M. and her life: "Those  who, like
us, knew extreme  experiences  very young (including  fame and love), and
who, arriving at maturity , want nothing more than life, simply ."
29.
C. returns.
September  2  at  Isle-sur -Sorgue.  Best  rule  for  this  notebook:  to
summarize  from time to time (2 times per week?)  the important  events of
the past period.  Saturday  the 30th I saw Jamois7  and agreed with her that I
could not immediately  present  The Possessed  in Montparnasse.  Despite
her dryness and air of bitterness , she has charm,  with her proper  sandals,
her  small,  well-kept  feet,  her  long  body,  and  this  beautiful,  sad  look.

Telephoned  Barrault  afterward  to tell him of my agreement.  Sleep early. I
don't sleep all night, fall asleep at 3 A.M., wake up at 5 A.M., eat a lot,
and, beneath  the rain, take to the road. I don't leave the steering  wheel for
eleven  hours-nibbling  a  biscuit  from  time  to  time-and  the  rain  doesn't
leave me either until I reach the Drome  where it lets up a bit over the
heights  of Nyons  so that the scent of the lavender  comes to me, awakens
me, and enlivens  my heart. The landscape  that I recognize  nourishes  me
again and I arrive happy. The Isle where,  in the scanty room at the Hotel
St. Martin, I feel at once sheltered and pacified.
Meet up with Rene Char at the Isle. Sadness  to see him chased out of
his house and his park (where  hideous  H.L.M.  buildings8  now rise) and
stuck  in  this  small  hotel  room  at  St.  Martin.  In  Camphoux,  at  the
Mathieu's,  Mme. Mathieu,  an aged Clytemnestra,  wears glasses.  As for M.
Mathieu,  the estate manager  became  an impotent  old man who can no
longer  even control his explosions.  I take care of the rented house,  a bit
sad but charming,  however , with its view of the Luberon.  Surely it will not
please X. But I try to make it more comfortable.  3 long walks with R.C.
on the roads of the Luberon  peaks. The violent  light, infinite  space, moves
me. I would like to live here again, find a house that suits me, finally settle
down a bit. At the same time, I think a lot about Mi. and about her life
here. At dinner, Mme. Mathieu  says: "Even the swallows  have become
foolish.  Instead  of taking silt for their nests they take the crop soil. And for
the first time in decades,  twelve  of the thirteen  nests in Camphoux  have
been crushed  along with their eggs" and Char: "one would  hope that at
least the birds would salvage honor ."
The 4th I am still awaiting  a telegram  or telephone  call from X. telling
me of her arrival with the children. It is Mme. Mathieu  who tells me that
X. will only stay here for four days and that her family  will be in Paris.
Anger and disaffection,  which mount against  her and against  me, we who
never stop waiting for signs of tenderness  there where there are none and
cannot be any .
September  30.

A month after looking  around  the Vaucluse  for a house,  purchased  the
one in Lourmarin.  Then off toward St. Jean to find Mi. For hundreds  of
kilometers,  through  the scent of the grape harvest,  elation.  Then the great,
foamy sea. Pleasure  like those long waves,  flowing,  grating  on. Depart  in
the morning for Paris and the pink briars in the pine forests.  Still twelve
hours behind the steering wheel, then Paris.
Visit from the writer turned  miserable  intellectual  (the slum of the St.
Denis suburb).
Pasternak.  ". . . this live and throbbing  element  of aristocratism  that,
following  Pushkin,  we call the highest  Mozartian  principle,  the Mozartian
element."
J. de Beer. "Adultery should  be punished  by death. True lovers could
then be counted ." Even this is not true. Often,  spinelessness  is stronger
than fear .
October  17.
Depart  Vaucluse. I should sum up these 18 days, and I will do so.
October  18.
.1 disembark  from the night train in the dry and cold mistral  at Isle-sur -
Sorgue. Fine and grand elation  all day in the glittering  light. I feel all my
strengths.
19.
Incessant  light. In the empty house, without  any furniture,  up for long
hours gazing at the dead leaves and red woodbine,  blown  by the fierce
wind, entering into the rooms.  The Mistral.

27.
Return  to Paris. During  the night reassuring  voices announce  the names
of the stations. Nation.
Do not complain.  Do not boast about what one is, nor about what one
does. If one gives, consider that one has received.
November 5.
Letter from E.B.'s husband  telling  me that his wife wants to commit
suicide  and  asking  me  to  intervene.  I  who  so  easily  and  often  so
senselessly  feels responsibility  toward  people,  I do not feel any in this
case. That said, I must intervene.
November  7,  45  years  old.  How  I  wanted  a  day  of  solitude  and
reflection.  Beginning  now, this detachment  will be realized  at fifty. That
day, I will reign.
Democracy  is not the rule of the majority  but the protection  of the
minority .
November 22.
Dinner  with Char and St. John Perse. Islands.  Afternoon  Waldo Frank"
in a dreary room.
December .
Possessed rehearsals.'  Curly, who is my age, seems too old to play
Stavrogin. M.  We change jobs, that's all. L. -  Yes, but women will
escape us and we will die.

MMi. Her marvelous appetite.
March 3.
I struggle like a fish caught in the net's meshes.
March 17.
Death of Paul Oettly2  at 69 years old. The next day his old mother  (93
years old) commits suicide.
Catherine is ill. I suspend my departure for the Midi. Heartache.
March 20.
Maman  operated  on.3  The  telegram  from  L.  reaches  me  Saturday
morning.  The following  night, airplane  at three o'clock  in the morning.  7
o'clock  in Algiers.  Always  the same impression  over this land of Maison-
Blanche4:  my land. And yet the sky is grey, the air gentle and spongy. I
settle at the clinic on the heights of  Algiers.
In the spotless room with bare white walls: nothing.  A handkerchief  and a
small  comb.  On  the  sheets:  her  knotty  hands.  Outside,  an  admirable
landscape  that extends  to the gulf. But the light and space bother her. She
wants the room to be kept shaded.
She speaks  of Philippe,  to whom Paule has just become  engaged: "His
father is good, his mother  is good, his sister is good. They are ancient
people.  He, he has done his duty. He has seen Paule to the petroleum  and
(gesture of two index fingers coming together).  All the better ."
"Later,  when  I  am  at  home,  the  doctor  will  give  me  something  to
recover ." She says "thank  you monsieur  Doctor." She cannot  do anything:

neither  read, she does not know how, nor sew or embroider , because  of her
fingers, nor listen, since she is deaf.  Time drips, heavy , slow . . .
Her lips have disappeared.  But her nose, so fine, so straight-her  large
forehead,  full of nobility , her brilliant  black eyes in the bony and shining
arch.
She suffers silently. She obeys. Around her the family sits, dense, mute,
and waiting.  . . . Her brother  Joseph,  younger  by a few years, also waits-
but as he would wait for his turn-resigned and sad.
March 23.
Bad  night.  It  rains  in  the  morning  over  the  gulf  and  the  hills. The
wisterias:  they  filled  my  youth  with  their  scent,  with  their  rich  and
mysterious  ardor.... Again,  endlessly . They have been more alive, more
present  in my life than many people  ... except  the one who suffers next to
me and whose  silence has never ceased  speaking  to me throughout  half
my life.
She says  Vichy5  for all mineral water .
The flesh, the poor flesh, miserable, dirty, faded, humiliated.  The sacred
flesh.
Leopold  [F ... 16 on Nietzsche:  "the consent  to the life that the union of
patience and revolt led to is the highest peak of life."
This strange  habit of preceding  her name with the distinction  Widow,
which had been with her all her life, and which still appears  on hospital
papers today .
She lived in ignorance  of all things-except  suffering and patience-and
she  continues  to  absorb  physical  suffering  today,  with  the  same
gentleness....

The  people  whom  neither  the  newspaper ,  nor  the  radio,  nor  any
technology  has touched.  As they were a hundred  years ago, and hardly
more distorted by the social context.
It looks like I've had blood in my stool. No?  Ah! Good.
The smell of syringes.  The hill covered  in acanthus,  reeds, cypress,
pines, palm trees, orange trees, medlar trees, and wisteria.
March 29.
Return to Paris.

Destroy everything in my life that is not this poverty . To lose everything.
Pasternak  on Scriabin8:  "Each one of us has known  a similar  moment

April 28.
Arrival  Lourmarin.  Grey sky. In the garden,  marvelous  roses weighed
down by water, luscious  like fruits. The rosemary  is in bloom.  Stroll, and

in the evening, the irises' violet shade deepens.  Worn out.
For years I've wanted  to live according  to everyone  else's morals. I've
forced myself to live like everyone  else, to look like everyone  else. I said
what was necessary to join together, even when I felt separate.  And after
all of this, catastrophe came. Now I wander  amid the debris,  I am lawless,
torn to pieces,  alone and accepting  to be so, resigned  to my singularity  and
to my infirmities.  And I must rebuild a truth-after  having  lived all my life
in a sort of lie.
At least the theatre helps me. The parody  is better than the lie: it is
closer to the truth that it performs.
May.
Resumed  work.  Have  progressed  with  the  first  part  of  First  Man.
Recognition of this country , of its solitude, of its beauty .

Television  broadcast.'  I cannot  "appear"  now without  causing  reactions.
Remember ,  repeat  to  myself,   constantly ,  that  I  must  eliminate  all
unproductive  polemic.  Exalt all which must be. Silence  the rest. If I do not
hold myself  to this rule, in the current  state of things,  I must agree to pay
and be punished . See stages of healing.'  Hang on to this precious  tremor,
this total silence that I have found here.  The rest does not matter .
For almost five years I have been critical  of myself,  of what I believed,
of  what  I  lived. This  is  why  those  who  share  the  same  ideas  believe
themselves  to be the target, and bear such an intense  grudge  against me;
but no, I wage war with myself  and I will destroy  myself,  or I will be
reborn, that is all.

The Marseillais  lovers.  Under the beautiful  sky, the juicy sea, the gaudy
and colorful city, their desire always renewed,  tiresome  at first and finally
throwing  them  into  an  endless  intoxication....  Only  the  creeks,  white
stones, and sea ablaze with light are chaste.

This is the red season. Cherries and poppies.
At noon the sound of a tractor  in the small valley of Lourmarin  ... Like
that of the boat's engine  in the port of Chios, overpowered  by the heat, and
I was in the shade-filled  cabin, waiting;  yes, like today, full of a love
without object.6
I love the small lizards,  as dry as the stones where they run. They are
like me, of skin and bone.
Paris, June '59.
I have abandoned  the moral point of view. Morals  lead to abstraction
and  to  injustic e.  They  are  the  mother  of  fanaticism  and  blindness.
Whoever  is virtuous  must cut off the heads. But what to say of those who
profess  morality  without  being able to live up to its high standards.  The
heads fall and he legislates,  unfaithful.  Morality  cuts in two, separates,
wastes  away. One must flee morality , accept being judged  and not judging,
saying yes, creating unity-and for the time being, suf fering agony .
Danoise de Joski.

The city drunk with heat.
Venice from July 6 to July 13.7
The heavy and dead heat, like an enormous  sponge,  was crushing  the
lagoon,  cutting  the hideaway  from the side of the Pont de la Liberte  and,
installed  above the city, weighed  on it, obstructing  the outlets  of the streets
and canals, filling all the free space between  the closely  situated houses.
No exit door, no escape,  a heat trap where we must live and go round in
circles.  An  army  of  hideous  tourists  turned  thus,  furiously ,  crazed,
sweating,  savage,  dressed  grotesquely ,  like  the  terrible  troupe  of  an
immense  circus, suddenly  idle and terrified  to be so. The whole city was
drunk  with  heat.  In  the  morning  we  read  in  11  Gazzattino  that  some
Venetians,  driven crazy by the heat, had been sent to the insane asylum.
Exhausted  cats were everywhere . Occasionally  one of them rose, risking  a
few steps on the burning  campo,  and at once the soft and malicious  sun,
which  was  on  the  lookout,  knocked  it  down.  Rats  hoisted  themselves
above the canals'  stagnant  waters and three seconds  later fell back into the
water en masse.  This soft and burning  heat seemed  to eat away at the
increasingly  decrepit city, the peeling  splendor  of the palaces,  the burning
campos,  the moldy foundations  and piles of mooring,  and Venice plunges
a little deeper into the lagoon.
We wandered, for our part, unable  to eat, and we nourished  ourselves
with coffees and ice creams,  unable  to sleep, and we no longer knew
where the days and nights began and ended.  The day surprised  us on the
Lido  beach,  in  the  tepid  and  viscous  morning  water,  or  on  a  gondola
wandering  in the lost canals while the sky became  a greyish  pink above
the suddenly turquoise  tiles. The city was empty then, but the heat did not
let up, neither  at this hour nor in the evening  hour, always  steady, always
burning  and humid,  and Venice has always  been surrounded,  while, giving
up hope of ever leaving,  we looked  only to breathe  one more time, and
another  still, in short to last in this strange  time without  landmarks nor
rest, nerves  on edge from coffee and insomnia,  torn from life. Beings
beyond  time, but beings,  likewise, that no one, nor anything  in the world,
desired  other than in the continuation  of this crazed and immobile  insanity ,

in  the  center  of  the  frozen  fire  that  devoured  Venice,  hour  after  hour,
endlessly , and at this point where we waited  for the instant  when suddenly
the city, earlier  still glittering  with colors  and beauty, would  sink into
ashes, which  not even the absent wind would  carry away. We waited,
hanging  on to one another , unable to separate  ourselves,  burning  also, but
with a sort of interminable and strange joy , on this pyre of beauty .
D.J. notices  a young Danish  girl, incidentally  rather ugly, on the terrace
of a cafe and then in the theatre.  He approaches  her, sits next to her, then a
few moments  pass, then they get up together . My heart aches seeing  the
submissive  air with which she follows  him. That submissivenes s that they
all have at this moment.
It is there that J. informs  me that she is pregnant  by P.; I advise her to
talk to him about it. He laughs  and an hour later returns  to his hotel with
X., in front of J. J. remains with X., who likes her , and falls silent.
Novel.  Love bursts between  them as a passion  of flesh and heart. Days
and days vibrant,  and a total blending to the point where the flesh becomes
sensitive  and touched  like the heart. United  everywhere,  in the sailboat,
and continuous  desire reborn  as emotion.  For him it is a struggle  against
death, against himself,  against  oblivion,  against  her and her weak nature,
and finally  he gives up, goes back between  her hands. And after her there
will be nobody  else, he knows  it, promises  it in the only place he finds
slightly  sacred.  At Saint Julien the Poor, where Greece  joins with Christ,
he decides  to keel) this promise despite  everything,  so that behind this
being  whom  he  clutches  against  him,  there  is  only  emptiness,  and  he
clutches  her tighter  and tighter, melting  into her, opening  her tip until the
agonizing  struggle to at last take refuge,  sheltering  himself  there forever,
in  the  love  finally  recovered,  the  place  where  the  senses  themselves
sparkle  in  the  light,  purify  him  on  an  unremitting  pyre,  or  a  jubilant
gushing  water-crowning  themselves  with a limitless  gratitude.  This hour
where the borders  of bodies fall, where the singular  being is finally born in
the total nakedness of profound benefaction.

Gratitude,  fiery  acknowledgme nt  to  Mi. Yes,  jealousy  testifies  for  the

of God.

It is in the sea that life is born, and for all of time immemorial , which
has  led  life  from  the  first  cell  to  the  organized  marine  creature,  the
continent,  without animal  or plant life, was only a land of stones filled
solely  with  the  sound  of  wind  and  rain  in  the  center  of  an  enormous
silence,  traverse d by no movement  other than the rapid shade of large
clouds and the racing waters over the ocean basins.

Thus I have chosen you and this is what will help me pass this bad
period,  to no longer suffer from the details  of what I recognize  as just and
legitimate in principle....

What  also  helped  me-equity-this  difficult  acceptance  of  oneself  and
others is creation. But since I am in this crisis, in this sort of impotence,  I
understand  this ignoble  desire for possession  that, in others,  has always
incensed  me.  One  can  conquer  a  being  for  lack  of  being  conquered
oneself.  And it is true that at precisely  this moment,  I have need of this
belonging  that you had given me. For this reason,  as much as for your
evasion,  I have suffered from your lie. But this will pass. A little more
pessimism  still and unhappiness  will radiate  :in turn: I will become  myself
again.
I have suffered from what you revealed  to me: that's a fact. But you do
not have to be sad for my sadness.  I am wrong,  I know it, and if I cannot
prevent  my heart from being unjust, I can at least make it capable  of
equity. It will not be difficult for me to overcome  the injustice  that I do to
you in my heart. I know that I have done everything  to detach  you from
me. All my life, as soon as a person  got attached  to me, I did everything  to
distance  them. There is of course  the incapacity  wherein  I am to make
commitments,  my taste for people,  of multiplicity , my pessimism  with
regard  to myself.  But perhaps  I was not as frivolous  as I say. The first
person  whom I loved and I was faithful  to escaped  me through drugs,
through  betrayal.  Maybe  many things came from this, from vanity, from
fear of suffering further, and yet I've accepted  so much suffering. But I
have in turn escaped  from everyone since and, in a certain  way, I wanted
everyone  to escape  from me. Even X. I have done whatever  necessary  to
discourage  her. I do not believe  that she escaped  me, that she gave herself
even fleetingly  to another  man. I am not sure [...].11  But if she did not do
it, it would be because  of a decision due to her inner heroism,  not because
of an overabundance  of a love that wants to give without  asking anything
in exchange.  So, I have done everything  necessary  in order for you to
escape  from  me.  And  the  more  the  captivation  of  that  September
increased,  the more I wanted  to break a certain  enchantment.  Thus, in a
certain  way, you have escaped  me. That is the sometimes  awful justice  of
this world. Betrayal answers  betrayal,  the mask of love is answered  by the
disappearance  of love. And in this particular  case, I, who have claimed
and lived all liberties,  I know and I recognize  that it is right and good that,

in your turn, you have lived one or two liberties.  The count is not even
complete.
To help myself,  in any case, I will not only help myself  to this cold
equity of the heart but to the preference,  to the tenderness,  that I carry for
you. I sometime s accuse  myself  of being incapable  of love. Maybe  this is
true, but I have been able to select a few people  and to keep for them,
faithfully , the best of me, no matter what they do.

4FTERIVORD
IN THE final weeks of December  1959, Albert  Camus  told his friend
Urbain  Polge: "What pleases  me is that I have finally  found the cemetery
where I will be buried.  I will be fine there."  Struggling  with his writing,
Camus  sent a letter to Catherine  Sellers  in which he wrote: "To work, one
must deprive oneself, and die without aid. So let's die, because I don't
want to live without  working...."  On December  30 he wrote a line to
Maria Casares  regarding  his return to Paris, which,  had the line been
written  in  one  of  his  novels,  would  certainly  have  seemed  to  stretch
believability:  "Let's  say  [Tuesday]  in  principle,  taking  into  account
surprises on the road ..... I
And  it  was  on  the  road,  five  days  after  those  words  were  written-
January  4,  1960-that  the  dashboard  clock  of  Michel  Gallimard's  1959
Facel Vega HK 500 stopped  ticking at 1:55 e.ni. The clock lay in a nearby
field. Fragments  of the wreckag e spread  almost  five hundred  feet. A tire
sat alone on the scarred  cement.  Drizzle  dotted the road. A black leather
valise lay in the mud, tossed next to the tree around  which the car was
wrapped.
Wedged into the back windshield  of the wrecked  automobile  was the
body of Albert Camus,  a long scratch etched  along his forehead,  his eyes
stretched  open. Killed instantly . Official cause of death: "fracture of the
skull and spinal column."
He was forty-six.
In time, Camus'  mud-caked  valise was returned  to his wife, Francine.
When  she  opened  the  briefcase-Camus  never  used  the  lock-she  found
several  items of note, including  a French  translation  of Nietzsche's  The
Gay Science and a copy of Shakespeare's  Othello,  also in a French  trans-
lation.2  At the time of his death, it is believed  Camus  had begun working
in earnest  on his adaptation  of the Shakespearean  tragedy , as later, in a

valise sent by train, Mme. Camus  discovered  a typed transcript  of the play,
which had her husband's  handwritten  revisions  and markings  throughout
the first three acts.'
Nonetheless  these  books  were  not  the  most  important  items  in  the
muddy  briefcase.  Among  Camus'  passport,  personal  photographs,  and
letters,  also inside the valise was the last volume  of these Notebooks  (IX),
which he carried  with him, literally , until his death. And then there was,
perhaps,  the  biggest  discovery:  Le  Premier  Homme,4  the  largely
autobiographical  novel that Camus had hoped would be his big book, his
War  and  Peace.  When  it  was  recovered  there  were  144  pages,  an
incomplete  first draft, scrawled  in his small, tight script,  often without
periods  or commas.  For years this draft remained  behind  closed  doors. It
was  not  until  1.994,  thirty-seven  years  after  the  French  journal  Arts
sarcastically  wrote of Camus,  "'Le Nobel couronne  une oeuvre  terminee,
that the general  public  would  finally  be offered a glimpse  of this last
unfinished manuscript and see for themselves that  Arts had been wrong.
In her introduction  to the American edition  of Le Premier  Homme,
Camus'  daughter , Catherine,  acknowledged  the hostile  attitudes  toward  her
father, which seemed  to permeate  France  at the time, as one of the main
reasons  the  manuscript  was  not  published  sooner.  But  when  the
manuscript  was finally  published,  instead  of drawing  the censure  of past
political  foes, the book met with widespread  critical  acclaim,  showing  Arts
and other politically  motivated  critics that Camus  clearly  had much left to
contribute.  Even  though,  after  winning  the  Nobel  Prize,  only  The
Possessed  and a handful  of essays were published  while he was still alive,
we can see in Le Premier  Homme  the promise  that Camus'  best work may
have been yet to come.
In addition  to Le Premier  Homme,  we can see in these Notebo oks the
beginnings  of several  projects  Camus  had planned  and begun taking notes
for.  There  were  the  two  plays:  one  concerning  the  life  of  Julie  de
Lespinasse  and the other attempting  to blend the legend  of Don Juan,
which had preoccupied  Camus  for much of his life, with that of Faust.
Then there was the essay on Nemesis,  who Camus  saw as the goddess  of

moderation  and on whom he had planned  to center his next major writing
cycle.  Like  the  previous  cycles-the  first  on  the  absurd,  the  second  on
revolt-this cycle on love was to involve a play , a novel, and an essay .
Ultimately , though,  none of these works would  be completed.  At the
point where he may have been at the top of  his craft, Camus  was removed
from the world,  and we were thus forced  to accept,  as Jean-Paul  Sartre
wrote in his Tribute 'o Albert  Camus,  that "every  life that is cut off-even
the life of so young  a man-is  at one and the same time a phonograph
record that is broken and a complete life."6
Camus  sensed  the immediacy  and constant  presence  of death around
him-he  knew all too well that his lungs would likely not allow him to live
to old age-but  with the many weights bearing  on him at the time, what he
might not have been so sure of, what we now know, what we see clearly,
is that his voice, like the last words of his Caligula,  is still alive and will
continue to live long past his shortened life.
